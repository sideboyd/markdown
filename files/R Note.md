# R Note

HI THERE,

let us show you how to get the most out of your learning experience!!!

get started

## how it works

in the editor on the right you should type R code to solve the exercises. when you hit the 'submit answer' button, every line of code is interpreted and executed by R and you get a message whether or not your code was correct. the output of your R code is shown in the console in the lower right corner.

R makes use of the # sign to add comments, so that you and others can understand what the R code is about. just like twitter! comments are not run as R code, so they will not influence your result. for example, calculate 3+ 4 in the editor on the right is a comment.

you can also execute R commands straight in the console. this is a good way to experiment with R code, as your submission is not checked for correctness.

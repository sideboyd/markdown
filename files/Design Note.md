# Get Professional. Useful Habits for UX Designers.

To become a UX expert, designers need to work hard on the daily basis. Constant self-improvement and love to what you do are two key factors helping to become a master of your craft. Of course, all UX experts have their personal secrets of the success still they have something in common. There are certain characteristics which differ amateurs from the real professionals. The new article describes habits which expert UX designers possess.

## They listen to users

The success of a product is defined by several points including the level of satisfaction which it brings to the users. To make a website or an application meet users needs, you have to know what exactly users require. So, before creating UX for digital product, the professionals always go user researching.

The process of user research applies collecting and analyzing the information received from the potential users. The obtained outcome helps designers go deeper into details of the target audience as well as comprehend their preferences and psychological peculiarities. Applying user research UX experts actually can step into the user' shoes and find the effective solutions for a user friendly product. UX design built on empathy has the great chances to meet users needs and draw attention to a product.

## They conduct usability testing

Usability is one of the key factors influencing the  quality of a digital product. so, to see if a website or an app is usable and to distinguish possible problems in UX, designers need to apply the technique of usability testing.

The level of usability is defined by five aspect: learnability, satisfaction, efficiency, memorability, and errors. learnability stands for how easy users can attain tasks during the first usage and satisfaction is if the usage process feels pleasant. efficiency is determined by users' ability to accomplish a task quickly while memorability depends on time which people need to re-establish their proficiency after a period of not using a product. and finally, designers track the number of errors users make and how easily they can learn from these mistake.

Usability testing is usually conducted at the UX building stage before a project goes to the development team. it allows changing inefficient solution easier than in a complete product. moreover, usability testing allows watching the users' reactions while a product is used and estimate how much they like it or don't. this technique is helpful for gathering the essential information for the effective user-centered design.

## They pay attention to the information architecture 

in one of our previous articles, we defined the information architecture as a science which strives at organizing and structuring content so that users would easily adjust to the functionality of the product and could find everything they need without big effort.

many UX experts learn the IA principles since they believe the information architecture is a foundation of the effective design. if the content is badly organized, users May have difficulties with navigation, so they can get lost and feel annoyed. that's why even compelling content elements and powerfully UI design can fail without appropriate IA.

some May think that it's impractical to devote much time to IA building and the effective information architecture is crucial for powerful user experience design. it helps users quickly navigate through content and find everything they need without striking a blow.

## They  strive for clarity 

a quality digital product has to give a quick access to the features which users come for. the main objective for designers is to help people easily reach the desired functionality and make the process of usage pleasant and clear.

while planning problem solving UX, professionals should work out which of design elements will be helpful and which of them will distract users. unneeded functionality makes a product complicated and has the bad influence on the user experience. what's more, it's important to keep mental models which include common UI patterns for specific types of products. the thing is that design is often built on the elements which are already familiar to users. such an approach make navigation much more intuitive and simple.

## They consider real life context 

Being an idealist is not always a good thing, especially for UX masters. it may happen that some designers just forget to consider all the life factors which have the significant impact on UX.

a product is often built and tested in comfortable conditions, but people do not always have a chance to use apps in such pleasant environment. the modern world is too rash and people often have lots of tasks to do per minute. however, despite all the circumstances websites and mobile applications need to be enjoyable. designers have to consider possible disturbance and create UX that way so people could manage everything even without being 100% engaged with a product, especially a mobile application.

## They are open to new tools

Being a profound user of Photo-shop or sketch is a great advantage for a professional still it's always a good idea to try new tools. it may seem as time waste for some designers so they don't see a point in it. however, you May be surprised how advanced the new technology can be and what functionality it provides. learning new tools you are not obliged to apply them as the major instruments but you can use them as additional helpers which will be useful in certain situations.

## They never stop learning

 UX design is a field which never stays still. each day brings new ideas and opportunities which designers willingly share around the world. today there are so many techniques and methods which UX experts apply for creating quality products and it May be hard to keep up with all of them. nevertheless, for a UX professional, it's vital to learn as much as they can because this kind of knowledge only improves the professional skills.

in addition, designers should  not concentrate only on the design aspects. learning the wide spectrum of sciences which somehow relate to the design can be extremely helpful in the creative workflow. for example, it is recommended to learn psychology which helps to understand users and their needs as well as learn some basics of programming so that you could have the better vision of product development.

## They stay up to date

Digital technologies evolve pretty fast and UX experts have to follow the updates. it would be difficult to create the proper design without knowing the peculiarities of the devices it's meant for. moreover, the trends in design field are also changing quickly so UX designers need to know what's on the top now and which solutions step aside.

## They don't forget to get inspired

 some people may think that UX design is a complex science with the strict rules which doesn't have a room for creativity. however, it's a FALSE thought since UX masters never forget to let the imagination out of control. many original and unique solutions are born due to designers' open-mindedness and inspiration. that's why designers always have to charge their creative power with the help of their favorite activities.

## To sum up

let's remember Sean covey's words:"we become what we repeatedly do."work hard , improve yourself and you will be able to become a master in your field. 

stay tuned!!!

# Keep Fit. UI Design for Fitness apps

a professional athlete billie jean king once said:"sports teaches you character, it teaches you to play by the rules, it teaches you to know what it feels like to win and lose.--- it teaches you about life." sports has become a part of your routine a long time ago. even more, today a healthy lifestyle is a top trend which constantly grows its popularity across the world.

fitness apps are the key helpers for people who strive to get fit. their functionality gives a lot of opportunities and makes keeping fit easier. understanding the significant impact of these applications on users' everyday life, designers do their best to activate the problem-solving potential of fitness apps. today's article describes common screens and essential UI elements for fitness apps.

## sign-in and profile screen

fitness app is something like a pocket instructor telling you what to do and gives a feedback on your achievements. to make it more comfortable and personalized, designers need to create an effective profile UI.

before users obtain their profiles they usually go through the sign-in process. fitness apps, as well as the other ones, can allow logging in via social networks still there are some aspects which users have to fill in to create a personalized profile. the applications usually require the personal data including age, gender, weight, and height which helps to define users' physical condition. profile creation is often similar to filling in an app;ication form. this way users can easily provide the needed information to make a profile more personalized.

the major objective of a fitness app is to help users in their self-improvement, the reason why profiles should contain not only the personal data but also the user's achievements such as the number of burnt calories or personal records in sports. it's important to not to overload the profile screen with the unnecessary information otherwise user interface may look chaotic.

## home screen

it's a core element for any type of apps. home screens serve as the main point where users start the journey within a product. creating UI for home screen designers need to think of it as a center of navigation and make sure users will be able to operate it easily.

first of all, home screen should provide access to the other parts of the app. designers can choose various ways of the presentation from a sidebar with minimalistic icons to the click-able sub-headers leading to the different sections of app content. the choice often depends on the number of features provided by the product as well as the platform which it is meat for.

## activity screen

people who aim at getting fit always have to do various physical activities. fitness apps provide users with the feature which helps to track how active they are during a day. to make a sufficient UI for activity screen, designers include different kinds of activities and sports. traditionally, fitness apps provide tracking time spent on sports as well as measuring the distance which users cover during a day. the distance can be calculated in two ways: walking is measured by the number of steps and running is usually measured in miles(kilometers).

the information about users' activity is often presented via diagrams of various forms. such presentation contributes the effective visual perception of the data which includes many numerals. also, designers often apply custom icons representing each kind of activity. this way the screen looks clean and neat even if users have a really active life.

## heart rate screen

the heart is an engine which lets our body live and function, so it's important to follow its condition daily. many fitness apps can be connected to the various devices such as fitness wearables which allow measuring pulse. the applications usually transfer the data gathered with devices on a heart rate screen.

user interface representing the feature should be simple with the minimum of elements so that it could be easily operated. since the process of pulse measuring takes some time it may be a good idea to supply the UI with sufficient animation which will show the loading process. for example, motion designers can animate an illustration of the heart showing it beats. custom illustrations along with motion design can make UI look more proficient and make the process of the pulse measuring more interactive.

## sleep tracking screen

nice sleep is a guarantee of the human health. sports people know it better than anyone else and always try to control the time and quality of their sleep. fitness apps show the gathered information during a night which includes the time and stages of sleep. there are four stages of sleep: the first and the second are called light sleep, the third is deep sleep and the fourth is rem sleep. the applications track these stages and in the morning users can see the statistics. the data on sleep is often shown as graphs.

## calories screen

they say that fitness people are obsessed with calories. well, there is truth in the words because if you want to get fit it's vital to control what and how much you eat. as we said above, fitness applications show the information on the number of burnt calories based on the activity results. the calories data can be displayed on the activity screen as well as on the personal profile. however, it may be an effective solution to create a separate screen to provide users with the expanded information on the lost calories.

## progress screen

to stay motivated and continue self-improvement, it's important to know that the hard work gives results. the progress screen shows the statistics about users achievements along with failures. here the graphs will be the best choice. if people have the progress, they see that their results are getting better and the scales on the graphs go higher.

## schedule screen

there can be many sports activities in different time and different places so the schedule seems to be essential in this situation. the screen of schedule is standardized, but to make it unique and original, designers can add some interesting icons representing various sports directions.

## goals screen

goals move us to achieve more and more, especially if we talk about fitness. people stat doing sport because they have some goals like losing wight or shaping up. in fitness applications, users set maybe a bit less radical goals but easier to achieve on a regular basis. they often include walking a certain number of steps per day or week along with burning the fixed amount of calories.

the screen of goals can be presented as a sheet divided into categories: to do, doing, done. this way users will see how much they have managed to achieve and what they need to strive for. in addition, designers can settle the system of awards which will help users be even more motivated. we've already described awards as effective gamification tools which contribute increasing user engagement. you can find detailed info in our previous articles.

the sport requires persistence and fortitude and so does the creation of sufficient UI design. learn the basics, add some inspiration and you can surprise yourself. 

stay tuned!!!

# case study: lunnscape. identity design for a landscape company 

the task of logo and identity development seems to be not really simple today. more and more companies and products are filling the market with branding designs of various complexity and quality. what ever is the business or charity, it needs the original and recognizable image to support brand awareness and promotion. on the other hand, is that so easy to get original stepping into the ocean of various and diverse competition? this is the time for designers to come into play.

today we offer you another case study showing the way which a brand passes to get its face designed in one of the recent projects, tubik team had a task of creating a logo for a landscaping business with further stretching the style and visual presentation on a number of items promoting the corporate identity. this challenge was assigned to graphic designer denys boldyriev.

# project

redesign of corporate identity for landscape firm lunnscape.

# process

Lunnscape is a company based in Florida, USA, and specializing in landscaping services to commercial properties like office and courtyard spaces, parks etc. the firm was founded by steven lunn in 2009: it's easy to see that the brand name presents the harmonic combination of the founder's name with the key word 《landscape》. being already established and known on the local market, the company strived for refreshing the visual identity and putting its promotion to the next level. the client came to us with a very basic branding they already used and wanted a new design corresponding to the modern trends and requirements and enhancing the connection with the customers.

we had already had a chance to create a brand identity for a landscape firm  - it was shared here in the case studies on logo design and corporate branding for andre. that made the challenge even more interesting, as the companies providing similar services had different approaches and vision of their brand images and needed new original looks. there is always the place for creative perspective in design, which makes the job so cool.

for this project, we accomplished a set of tasks according to the client's marketing strategy:

1. landscape company logo
2. slogan
3. theme illustrations
4. corporate letterhead, envelop, and business cards
5. stationery
6. corporate vehicle
7. style guile

# logo

brainstorming ideas on the task to design a logo for a landscaping business, most people will imagine something connected with plants, flowers or their elements. that's a natural and very quick association. actually, that approach had also been followed in the previous version of the logo presented with a simple stroke image featuring a leaf. however, keen on getting fresh stuff which would distinguish the company from the competitors, the client stated the wish to step aside from the traditional associations and try other creative directions. they wanted the brand sign to be dynamic, immediately connected to the theme of nature but moving away from ideas and patterns typical for landscaping logo design.

as well as in the previous case study on identity for reborn restaurant, early ideas were visualized in in the quick pencil sketches to catch the the possible silhouette of the future logo and discuss possible directions of creative search with the stakeholders. after that, the set of basic digitized options were offered. to make the picture full and ensure how far the logo should move from the common associations set, the designer provided the variety of options, as you can see below. some of the options were visually connected to the plants and greenery, for example, the letter mark made of leaves, the image of a flower, the shapes of landscape site patches also resembling the flower petals. also, there were shown the shapes of trees presented in balanced geometric forms giving the room for flexibility in a landscape logo design. the other options in this set were focused on dynamic images of living creatures like insects or birds.

so, it's easy to see that in general, the creative search moved around two global themes, flora and fauna, both effective to set the instant connection to the theme of nature and land care. thinking about the number of factors, the client put their preference on the image of a dragonfly as a mascot. here's the next stage of the logo design process - construction of a symbol image.

for the variety of usage options, the mascot image was added with the word mark featuring the company name and accomplished in a style harmonically corresponding to the mascot. so, the final lunnscape logo is designed as a mascot of a dragonfly in an aqua circle depicting one of the fauna symbols which habitats in Florida nature. the dragonfly visualizes a bright creature on a green lawn, besides, its wings look like flower leaves. turquoise circle with a dragon fly gives a solid stamp effect as well as looks playful due to the color palette. the word mark typography complements and also unveils the core brand services of the company.

both the brand mark and word-mark go hand in hand to keep an ultimate balance for user's perception and brand recognition. having agreed and polished all the details in the landscape logo design, the creative team moved to the work on slogan and corporate identity development.

# slogan

the next step of the creative process was to support design with copy-writing: the company needed a new slogan, so the copywriter was also engaged in the project. short and catchy, the slogan had to support the idea of the beauty made by people but rooting in natural harmony. what's more, the slogan had to set the tight link with the logo, so that in combination they effectively supported each other.

the company name uses the altered version replacing the keyword "land" with "lunn", but still preserves the general structure of the word so that the word "landscape" could be easily restored in mind. among several directions for the slogan, we developed the one which used the word "land" acturalizing its double meaning: land as an object of services the company provides and land as the action of coming down through the air and rest on the ground or another surface. this approach enabled to set the link with the logo featuring the dragonfly so that together they presented the clear message.

after discussing the several sets of variants, the final version of the slogan was agreed upon "landed on nature beauty".

# branded items

stationery and business cards

the designer prepared a set of templates for company documents, including business cards, letterhead, and envelopes, that reflect the brand identity in an elegant, non-distracting way. it enabled to stretch the design solutions of logo design for the landscape company and give them flexible ways of usage for different business purposes. as you can see below, business cards and the title page of a letter blank used the stroke version of the logo appplied to the combination of corporate colors.

# 7 tips to enhance mobile interactions

the quality of mobile design can be measured simply. when the process of usage is so smooth and effortless that people don't even think about it, it is the sign of the professional design work. on the other hand, if there are some problems in the inter action system, users will definitely notice them and won't be pleased about it.

mobile apps are expected to be clear and easy to operate so that they could be effectively used anytime and anyplace. designers' task is to create an intuitive interface which will guide users within the app helping them operate its functionality without problems. in this article, we describe the essential aspects of the effective mobile interaction system along with the tips helping designers to create intuitive design.

## increase learnability

every designer strives at creating a unique product with original interactions and navigation systems. such an approach allows standing out a crowd and being noticeable on the market. however, creating absolutely new environment designers have to think how users will adjust to it.

if the interaction system of a mobile application has no logic and sequence or it doesn't respond to needs of the target audience, it may be frustrating and annoying. that condition is critical for ux, so people will simply give up on trying to decipher an app and quit it.

to avoid this kind of outcome, designers need to care about learn-ability of the interactive elements. learn-ability stands for how easy tasks can be attained during the learn-ability, designers need to keep it simple and clear helping quickly adjust to it. also, the system should be consistent and logical so that users could identify the repeating patterns and use a mobile app intuitively.

## consider multiple holds

we all are different in many ways, even how we hold smart-phones. the way of holding smart-phones depends on various factors including the situation and conditions in which the app is used as well as the task we need to accomplish.

there are three common types of holding a mobile. the first is when we take it with one hand and navigate it with a thumb. another way is to hold a smart-phone in one hand and interact with it with the forefinger of the other hand. also, the type which is common for chatting people is holding a phone in two hands using both thumbs for actions. of course, there are other types of holds but these three are thought to be the most common.

considering this fact, designers have to figure out if the layout elements placed effectively for different holds. one handed hold requires special attention since it has the most limited space of reach. to make the interaction process within a mobile app effortless it may be a good idea to put the key components at the bottom of the screen so that users would be able to reach tap areas easily. in addition, the interactive elements should be big engough so there would be no chance for a mis-tap.

## apply recognition patterns

when a new app can be used intuitively it means that the designer did a good job. to provide intuitive interactions, UI design has to contain recognition patterns. they are the elements which users are already familiar with and those which give slight hints on how a app works. the thing is that using an application we are expecting to see certain things associated with the definite kind of product. for example, working with e-commerce apps we are used to seeing cart icons along with CTA buttons "buy". familiar elements in a new app make people feel more confident in their actions.

users become accustomed to things quickly and their absence makes them feel uncomfortable. that's why, if you plan to use custom interactive elements, don't forget to add some standard components. this way a new application won't overwhelm with an absolutely unfamiliar environment and will help to learn quickly.

## make a clean UI

a big pitfall of mobile UI design is small screens of the devices. designers have to figure out how to cnclude all content in a short space without turning user interface into clutter. clean UI design helps effectively interact with a product since all the core elements can be easily reached.

to create neat mobile UI it is recommended to use icons as interactive components. copy elements often can be too big for the small screen, so icons are a sufficient alternative. they can explain a function visualizing it with simple shapes and it helps to save the space on the screen. however, during usability testing, it should be thoroughly checked if the icons are perceived appropriately and transfer the right message.

## decrease the number of actions

probably, many of us have the experience of using an annoying mobile app which made us take a long way before we could finally accomplish the task. it may often be caused by ineffective interaction system which employs too many actions and the unnecessary functionality.

mobile apps usually serve as problem-solving assistants, so it's vital for them to be designed ergonomically. it means that designers have to apply only core functional elements which will get the users right to the point they needed. minimum of actions won't make your product look primitive. it will help a mobile app be effective and pleasing in usage. remember that people mostly rate the quality of an application not by extraordinary features but how helpful it is.

## add game mechanics

based on the facts described above, we can say that an effective mobile interaction system should be simple and clear to use so that it could be operated without problems.

however, simplifying the interface it's vital not make it boring. apps which seem ordinary have fewer chances to gain users' attention. that's why it's important to bring some emotional aspects into applications that look standard at the first glance.

to make the process interesting and catchy, it may be a good idea to use gamification. it is the technique of exerting game mechanics into the non-game environment like mobile applications. various challenges and leader-boards along with the awards and stickers motivate users to interact with a product more and come back to it constantly.

what's more, implementing a game mechanic called a user journey is an effective way to create clear layout and transitions. a journey is user's progression stages at the time of usage. designers create UX that way so that people could go step-by-step through the various features which gradually change depending on needs of the target audience. an approach helps to avoid problems with incomprehensible interactions and functions.

last but not least, gamification adds the elements of fun. users enjoy entertainments, challenges, and competitive spirit similar to video games, so they are encouraged to go back. people always need some kind of recreational activity so that they could escape from everyday routine for a bit. by adding the fun element into a casual application, you help to reduce some stress and relax for a moment.

## don't forget about testing

mobile interaction design aims at creating a user-friendly product which will be pleasure to use under different circumstances. but how can a designer define if an app is usable enough and distinguish possible problems in UX? this is when usability testing comes into play.

usability testing is an essential stage in creating mobile apps helping to evaluate it by testing on the potential audience. it is usually conducted at the UX building stage before a project goes to the development team so that inefficient solutions could be changed easier and faster.

various usability testing methods allow identifying problems and bugs and quickly eliminate them. this way designers can improve all the aspects of UX ensuring user satisfaction.

so, before you deliver a project to the development team remember to handle testing. test it by yourself, on your colleagues, on the potential users and then you'll get the desired outcome.

a simple mobile interaction system is not that easy to create. it requires hard word, concentration and lots of practice before you receive sufficient results. 

stay tuned!

# feel homey. handy tips for home page design

there's no place like home, they say. and in the growing world of websites for all the needs and aims, it actually works the same. home page has multiple functions: it's a card of invitation, a starting point of the journey around the website, a storage of the vital links and data, and a strategic asset for marketing goals. in the majority of cases, it is often the first visual and emotional touch to the website. no doubt, design is one of the core ways to make this touch gentle, smart and helpful. today we are discussing some effective tips for creating user-friendly home pages.

one of our previous articles has already given the insights into the definition, types of content such a page usually includes and basic design strategies in creasing home page usability. continuing the topic, today we are adding more recommendations organized around three essential aspects: information, interaction, and appearance.

## information

to use or not to use? that is the question. in the vast majority of cases, home page is the point of user's decision. in the early 2000s guru of usability Jacob Nielsen mentioned in his article: your home page is often your first - and possibly your last - chance to attract and retain each customer, rather like the front page of a newspaper. with all the progress the world wide web has witnessed, this position doesn't change: home page often defines if a user goes further around the website. and it is done not only by beauty and style but first of all by information which is looked for by visitors to the resource. making it accessible, noticeable and clear, designers grow the chances of positive user experience.

 in general, home page can include the following data:

1. the nature of the website: the page has to instantly inform users if it's a company website, blog, e-commerce website, social network, educational platform or anything else;
2. brand or company identity elements: home page requires a recognizable visual presentation distinguishing the website from its competitors. if there is  a product, company or  brand behind it, web-page design should be seen as a brand and apply strategies of identity design for better brand awareness.
3. benefits of the website: it should quickly inform users why the website can be helpful or interesting for them.
4. internal search: many users come to the websites with clear goals, so functionality to search right from the homepage will make interaction highly productive.
5. links to the core interaction zones
6. contact data and links to social networks
7. signs of trust: testimonials, reviews, big numbers of presence in social networks



the solution which of the mentioned points are going to be included and how they are going to be spread on the layout should depend on the goals of the website and the research of target audience. let's check some tips effective in this aspect.

## fill the header with core data

as we mentioned in the article about web header design, it is the top part of the web-page, which people see before scrolling the page in the first seconds of introduction to the website. headers can include a variety of meaningful layout elements, for example:

1. basic elements of brand identity: log, slogan etc.
2. tag-line setting the theme of the website
3. links to the core categories of website content
4. links to the most important social networks
5. basic contact information
6. a language switch in case of multilingual interface
7. search field
8. subscription field
9. links to interaction with the product such as trial version, downloading from the App-Store etc.


obviously, it's impossible to put all the list into one header. moreover, its not a good idea to put everything because the header overloaded with diverse information will distract users' attention. as Arron Walter said in his book, if everything yells for your viewer's attention, nothing is heard. that is why the choice which information goes to the header and what is looks like arises on the solid ground of communication between a designer, a stakeholder and a marketing specialist. header is the top zone of early interaction: eye-tracking studies show that the web page is mostly scanned starting from it. so decide, which elements are primary to achieve website goals and use the limited space of header for them. for example, on a news website or a big e-commerce platform search field is crucial for positive UX while on a small company website it may be not needed at all.

 ## apply informative tag line

don't think the users are going to wander around the website trying to set why it's useful for them. being surrounded by the thousands of website, they may get away at the first seconds if they don't see a clear reason to stay. so, give it to them - it's the time for a tag line. in marketing terms, it is the name of a short and catchy phrase that summarizes the benefits or gives the description of the website. including the keywords setting the proper theme and taking the place on the first level of visual hierarchy for the page, the tag line will quickly inform users why the website is worth their attention.

## enable users to contact with duty holders

home page is usually the place where people expect to find the contact info any time they need it. the most popular placement for it is footer, the bottom part of the page. however, if any kind of contact data is core for conversion, it's logical to put in the pre-scroll area or even a header. for example, if the website presents the delivery service or on-line shop, users may want to call more frequently and this ability will have a direct impact on conversion rate. meanwhile, for an entertainment or news resource, it may be not that crucial so it's placed in zones of less active interaction. however, in any case, the contact data should be available from home. among other reasons, it is one of the factors influencing the level of trust to the website.

contacts can be presented in various formats. they can reveal the data such as phone number and location, emails, links to messengers, contact forms and instant chat window. making the phone numbers clickable is supportive as many users now browse from their smart phones and may want to call right from there. the address can be also clickable opening the screenshot or map showing how to find the location. the solutions have to be based on thoughtful user research setting target audience's expectations, level of tech literacy and the most convenient ways of contact for them. for instance, if your target audience is teenagers, just giving the phone number may be not effective as they really stick to messengers and social networks. at the same time, if your users are elderly people, social networks may not work in comparison to a phone number.

## make call to action element instantly visible

unlike the landing pages, focused on narrow and concise goals, home page contents are quite diverse. that's why it's important for a ux designer to care how users will see what they really need to see in all that mass of data. no doubt, it cannot happen that all, let's say, fifty available links on the home page are equally important. so, to make the page usable, all the interactive elements in the layout should be prioritized. visually, it can be done via the rules of visual hierarchy so taht users could see the key things first. and among them, call to action elements should be noticed instantly. otherwise, there will be loss in conversion not because users didn't want to do the action but because they did't find how to do it.

## interaction

the next aspect to consider is interaction - hte way how users perceive, process and interact with the information they find on the home page as well as the website in general. the next set of tips is all about that.

check scannability and mind eye-tracking models

it's not a secret that users first scan pages and only then make a decision if they want o get dip into details. interface designers are highly recommended to study eye-tracking models which are now described in numerous publications, with the most prominent contribution by Nielsen Norman Blog sharing the results of actual experiments in that sphere for a couple of decades. in brief, researchers mention three typical models of scanning: Gutenberg Diagram, Z-Pattern, And F-Pattern. in case you want to get more, we have given detailed descriptions in an earlier article, so now let's just check them on schemes.

scannability of web pages i enhanced with visual hierarchy that enables designers to show the content in terms of its priority and navigates user from the core zones to the secondary ones. scannability is one of the parameters to be carefully tested all the time as it has a great impact on usability of the page and its problem-solving potential.

## remember that patterns are user's friends

every creative person feels the urge to apply the original and unique solutions and think out of the box all the time. however, make not to go too far on that way. remember that the website is made not for creative contests or gallery of fame but for real users. as we mentioned in the post about social networks design, the power of habit in terms of user experience can be stronger than the wish of revolution. surely, the dose of wow-effect is needed, but not so much to knock down the user. on home page, too much of design revolution might confuse and scare: if the first page is so hard to understand, user thinks, what's going to be next? study the habits of interaction and typical products for that particular target audience to make their habits their power. strive for the balance between innovation and traditions.

## make the search field easily accessible

as we said above, search means much, especially for the users coming to the resource with a clear understanding what they want. A/B testing can support the analysis of its most productive placement on the page layout. it can be a small search field, an icon in the header, a long horizontal field across the page as we have here in Tubik Blog. the main thing is to make it noticeable and clear so that users didn't waste their time.

## use different menus and interaction zones

as home pages can provide a variety of links, tabs, fields and buttons, they should be grouped in different menus and zones instead of being given as the list of links. for example, double menu in the header can present two layers of navigation. we have shown the example of such a trick in the case study for a bakery website design. the website uses a sticky header which has two levels of navigation. the upper menu shows the links to social networks, the logo, search, shopping cart and hamburger button hiding the extended menu. the second line of navigation gives instant connection to the core interaction areas: products catalog, locations for the point of sales, news and special offers, information about the service and contact section. visual and typographic hierarchy makes all the elements clear and easily scanned providing solid ground for quick interaction right from home page.

## make the home page accessible from any point of the website

home is usually the foundation of the website structure. so, users need to have a chance to get back home from any page they are on. check it when all the pages are designed not to miss this abvious still vital interaction.

## don't direct all the outer traffic to home page

for simple one page websites this question is not actual: indeed, they represent only a home page which satisfies one or multiple functions and there is no other place where the traffic could be directed from the outer sources. the same happens if the website is not complex, home is not overloaded with diverse links and navigation elements, so conversion can be reached right from it while other pages play secondary roles. in this case directing all the traffic to the most informative part of the site, which also enables a user to accomplish necessary action and get what they need, is a good idea.

however, for complex websites and platforms, especially if they satisfy multiple needs of broad target audience, this approach can be the step killing profitability and reducing conversion rates. the user can get scared, distracted or even annoyed with the amount of information they have to get through to find what they need, especially if focused on a particular narrow goal. using landing pages in the case when you need to concentrate user's attention on something specific can be the efficient way of solving this problem. landing page is focused on one item, to make it quickly found and reduce delays when target user seeks for specific operations, services or items. this is the issue of especially high importance in the case of e-commerce websites when unwise design solutions bring to poor user experience and financial losses.

## appearance

the third set of tips is concentrated on the page looks. no doubt, the recommendations are applicable for any kind of webpage, still, on home page, they ten to be more influential.

## be stringent in color choice

color is power which can either strengthen or ruin other design decisions. choosing the color palette, remember that colors influence user perception. studying color psychology is helpful to make choices that transfer the right message. attention to traditional color theory will help to find the color combinations that will look elegant and harmonic. one more popular issue is choosing between light or dark background: the solution is mostly based on the type of content website presents. text- based websites usually use light and airy interfaces while visual based ones can apply dark background to make the images look deeper and more stylish.

## apply recognizable visual prompts and associations

being full of data, home pages usually include the variety of icons and illustrations. choosing them, always test their recognizability and check if they build right associations. if there is the risk of double meaning or culture differences of target audience, supporting the icons or illustrations with a short copy might be helpful.

## mind the typography issues and readability

 ratings of e-commerce are booming and rocketing. people are getting more and more confident in buying things on-line. the report by big commerce on customers buying habits in 2016-2017 shows really interesting stats about on-line shopping:

1. 51% of Americans prefer to shop on-line
2. 96% of Americans with Internet access have made an on-line purchase in their life, 80% in the past month alone
3. E-commerce is growing 23% year-over-year, yet 46% of American small businesses do not have a website
4. on-line orders increase 8.9% in Q3 2016, but average order value(AOV) increased only 0.2% - indicating that transactional growth is outpacing total revenue



the numbers above still haven't stopped their increasing. that wouldn't be reasonable for any business to ignore such global trends having a great impact on profits and reaching customers. for the last couple of years here in tubik we see the obvious and logical growth of interest from big and small businesses in establishing their presence on-line via websites and mobile applications. based on our experience and the research of the sphere today we offer you the article telling a bit more about strategies and best practices in UI design for e-commerce.

so, let's start with the 11 points which are important to consider when you are designing e-commerce user interfaces.

## 1. make the branding instantly visible

from the business perspective, branding is a crucial thing: it enables to provide a product, company or service with a recognizable face and personality. in general terms, branding means a sort of image created via a set of distinguishing features and promoting awareness and recognizability of the product or service on the market.

branding tends to be essential in an e-commerce user interface design, especially if stakeholders want to use the digital product as the additional flow of customer attraction. moreover, identity integrated thoughtfully into the interface is the effective way to increase brand awareness. the time taken for proper market and user research, target audience definition, competition analysis and development of brand identity on the basis of all that data by a professional designer is a worthy investment. if that's done before launching the process of UI design, the product gets higher chances of becoming recognizable faster and easier.

in this case, UI designer working on the interface, its color palette, shapes, types and fonts, illustrations and icons, will consider design solutions appropriate and corresponding to the general branding concept of the product that will make them mutually supporting each other. it provides more natural and harmonic feeling of the brand in general and the particular interface as an integral part of this brand.

there are numerous ways to add branding to the interface, still some layout zones and elements which have the highest potential in this issue:

headers. in the article about website header design, we showed in detail that headers present the area of high visibility. so putting strategically important elements of branding in it is a good way to strengthen its memorability.

splash screens. in mobile applications, splash screen or welcome screen is the first screen seen by a user while the application is loading and starting. it's good idea to use a logo, mascot or any other thing setting the instant visual connection with a brand. moreover, adding a bit of wow-effect with slight stylish animation, it's easy to make the sign even more attractive and memorable.

pre-loaders and pull-to-refresh indicators. these are the elements which show the flow of the current loading process on the app or website. branding applied elegantly in them can add much into the consistency of both UI and identity design.

mascots. mascots are images, usually personified, which often represent the brand, product or service identity and can be its symbolic convention in all the application or website. mascots push the limits of personification and give the chance to create the unexpected combinations of elements or make fantastic and non-existing characters alive. a mascot becomes the element of identity and inter-connector between the user and the product. in many cases, it is the basic element of communication and interaction delivering the necessary message to the user.

## 2. set clear and easy navigation as the core task

in the article on UX design for e-commerce, we stated: whatever an amazing website or app is, whatever the stylish and trendy design and breathtaking images it features, its success will be measured not by the number of wows. the efficiency is analyzed simply - by he number of complete purchases. if users don't buy, design means nothing while stakeholders lose their money, clear intuitive navigation plays the premier violin here. at every step of interaction, uses need to understand clearly plenty of simple things, like:

1. what company or brand they are dealing with
2. what page they are at
3. where the menu is
4. how they can get back to home page or catalog
5. where the search and filters are
6. how long the page-loading process is going to take
7. how they can see the detailed information about the item
8. how they can choose between the option for the same item (color, size, etc)
9. how they can pay for the item
10. how they can save the items they could like to get back to later
11. how they can contact the seller
12. how they can see the rating and reviews of previous buyers etc.


## 3. check the scannability of the page or screen

as it was already mentioned, users don't usually read and observe all the content on the page or screen from the starting point: instead, they start from quick scanning to understand if it contains something they need or want. knowing the eye-tracking models, gestalt principles and laws of visual hierarchy, designers and information architects can put the core data and interaction elements to the zones of high and natural visibility.

calls to action(CTA), in particular, should be instantly seen in the first seconds on the page or screen. in the interfaces for e-commerce, CTA elements are the core factor of effective interaction with the product playing the crucial role in usability and navigability and therefore in getting profits. when all the path of interaction and transitions is built clearly for users but CTA elements is not thought-out, placed or designed well, users can get confused and will need to take additional effort trying to achieve their goals. that increases the risk of poor conversion rate and general user experience.

## 4. minimize user's efforts whenever its possible

the respect to the customer lies not in pouring out your thanks. the real respect is in saving users' time and effort day in and day out. here are some design practices which can make the inter face effort-saving.

show related products. seen on the item page as recommendations close to the features of this particular product can make the process of search and browsing much faster for users. however, it's vital to check together with developers that this section really works according to the algorithm which show s suitable items, not random ones.

strive for a minimal number of clicks. if going from page to page or jumping from screen to screen is not a part of the journey into the sales funnel, save every users' click possible. too many operations are tiring and annoying which is a kind of negative emotion. and emotions have a huge influence on user experience and make retaining users much harder. minimize the number of clicks on the way of choosing and buying whenever it's possible - his way you respect user's time better than politest word of thanks.

simplify the sign-in process. imagine the situation when you got to the amazing website selling the goods of your dream, and they presented in such a stylish way that you want to buy them at once. but when you click the button buy, you are taken to the huge long from which you have to fill in to register on that website. that will cool down your hot wish to buy everything right here, right now, isn't it ? you change from the state take my money, give me that to really? 20 points to fill in before i can buy? in split seconds. not all the users will survive that transformation and the website or app will lose a part of buyers. so, it's necessary to make the sign-in/log-in process as simple as possible.

user shape and color marking to group the items or types of content. color and shape codes enable designers to apply gestalt principle of similarity not only on one screen or page but on the whole app or website. color or shape markers simplify navigation and keep the consistency of design enabling users to remember the prompts and find content they want easily. for e-commerce platforms which are usually full of numerous items, it can make the interface much more user-friendly.

check that perception of the layout is natural and harmonic for the human eye. there are numerous things that have an impact on decision-making, and harmony is one of them. eye-tensing color combinations, unreadable or not combining fonts, aggressive background, intrusive pop-ups or animations, annoying sounds or pages loading for ages- any point of that stuff can spoil the experience quickly and move users away.

## 5. don't go too far experimenting

there are many articles and videos calling creative people to hear their heart, trust their guts and think out-of-the-box. however, design is not just pure creativity striving to show all the power of original solution. first of all, it the way to solve the problem and make users happier. so, it's vital to look at the interface from user's perspective and find the way to make interactions that will provide the smooth and easy way to conversion. in the article on home page design strategies we mentioned: the website is made not for creative contests or gallery of fame but for real users. the positive impact of habit in terms of user experience can be stronger than the wish of revolution. surely, the dose of uniqueness is needed, but not so much to knock down the user. in e-commerce UI design, often aimed at quite a diverse target audience, too much of revolution might confuse and scare: do i really need to buy this thing, a user may think, if it's so hard to get it? study the interaction patterns and typical products for that particular target audience to make their habits their power. and don't forget to check that all the icons on the screen don't have a double meaning. strive for the balance between innovation and traditions.

## 6. use landing pages for specific purposes

for business aims and profits rate, this tip may bring crucial changes. e-commerce UI design principles are usually based on dealing complex websites or apps which are filled in with a variety of information. so, the approach of directing all the traffic from outer sources to the home page can be step killing profitability and reducing conversion rates. users might get overwhelmed, distracted or even annoyed with the amount of data they have to process finding what they need, especially if they are focused on a particular narrow goal presented in the source they came from. using landing pages when you need to concentrate user's attention on something specific can solve this problem efficiently. landing page is focused on one item, to make it quickly found and reduce delays when target user seeks for specific operations, services or items. this is the issue of especially high importance in the case of e-commerce websites when unwise design solutions bring to poor user experience and financial losses.

## 7. make the homepage informative

home page can satisfy multiple functions: it's a card of invitation, a starting point of the journey around the website, a storage of the vital links and data, and a strategic asset for marketing goals. in the majority of cases, it is the first visual and emotional touch to the website. certainly, design is one of the core ways to make this touch gentle, smart and helpful. with all the progress the world wide web has witnessed, this position doesn't change: home page often defines if a user goes further around the website, not only by beauty and style but first of all by information which is looked for. making it accessible, noticeable and clear, designers grow the chances of positive user experience.

in general, home page can include the following data:

1. the nature of the website
2. brand or company identity elements
3. internal search
4. links to the core interaction zones
5. contact data and links to social networks
6. signs of trust(testimonials, reviews, big numbers of presence in social networks etc)
7. for e-commerce websites, it can be visual presentation of bestselling and exclusive items, for example, specific books, toys, clothing, equipment etc.

the solution which of the mentioned points are going to be included and how they are going to be spread on the layout should depend on the goals set for the website and the research of target audience.

## 8. apply high quality images giving the message

images take a big part in usability: as the vast majority of users are visually driven, images become the hook points of getting basic data about the website or app. they present the part of the content which is both informative and emotionally appealing. the level of detail and functionality allow classifying the images in user interfaces into types, among which:

1. photos:theme photos creating the appropriate mood and setting the message, demonstration photos, photos of the items, title photos for blog articles and pages of special offers etc.
2. illustrations: custom illustrations in graphic interface design can look both informative and original allowing the design to stand out of the competition.
3. hero banners: applied mostly in web design, they are big images which are usually the first visual element catching user's attention in the initial seconds of interaction; they usually give the attractive visual presentation of the main content of the resource.
4. icons: these are small but meaningful pictograms which are informative and support data exchange between the informer and addressee. icons play the key role in providing clear and intuitive navigation, but they should be checked on proper clarity and the absence of double meanings.
5. mascots: images, usually personified, representing the brand, product or service identity.
6. visual identity elements: various visual signs of branding like logos, custom lettering for brand name and slogan etc.

## 9. think about promotional videos of different kinds

there are several common types of promotional videos:

1. introduction video: the first insights on the company, product, or brand showing its benefits for users
2. product presentation videos: details about product's features and advantages, special steps of interactions and the problem solving potential of the product.
3. landing page videos: strengthening the message driving users to a particular call to action offered on the page
4. video testimonials: the reasons and signs of trust and loyalty to the company, brand or brand.
5. entertaining and educational videos: rising emotional appeal and often presenting the material for viral marketing

all the mentioned types can serve efficiently for marketing goals and increase brand awareness. a creative and catchy video is a good way of attracting customers' attention and the proven method of informing them quickly and brightly. a video activates several channels of perception: audio, visual, sound. simultaneously and usually do it in a way of telling a story. people are daily overloaded with tons of information of all kinds, so most of them aren't ready to devote much time learning about products or services, especially the new ones. in these conditions, video can become the way of communication which is dynamic, informative and attractive. however, the technical side should be double checked so that the video was integrated correctly and didn't overload the page.

## 10. let the user contact the duty holders from any point of interaction

 the most popular placement for contact information is footer, the bottom part of the page. however, if any kind of contact data is core for conversion, it's logical to put in the pre-scroll area or even a header. for example, on an e-commerce website, presents the on-line shop, users may want to call more frequently and this ability will have a direct impact on conversion rate. anyway, the contact data should be available at any point users may need it. among others, it is one of the factors influencing the level of trust to the website.

contacts can be presented in various formats. they can reveal the data such as a phone number and location, emails, links to messengers, contact forms and instant chat window. making the phone numbers click-able is supportive as many user now browse from their smart-phones and may want to call right from there. the address can be also click-able opening the screen-shot or map showing how to find the location. the solutions have to be based on thoughtful user research setting target audience's expectations, level of tech literacy and ways of contact which are the most convenient for them. for instance, if your target audience is teenagers, just giving the phone number may be not effective as they really stick to messengers and social networks. at the same time, if your users are elderly people, social networks may not work in comparison to a phone number.

## 11. add gamification

gamification integrated into digital products is a great way to stimulate users' extrinsic motivation, which is mostly a seek of reword, which can be tangible,money, prizes, diplomas, certificates, trophies,medals. and intangible . so, challenges, leader-boards, rewards for loyalty and big orders, discounts, badges, coupons, stickers and all the other stuff of that kind can become great stimuli for users to not only start interaction with a website or app but also stay there and buy regularly.

the offered e-commerce UI design examples and strategies, for sure, do not cover the whole scope of issues to consider in this fields. however, they can serve as a useful checklist or a source of UI design inspiration for those who aim at creating user friendly platforms supporting business goals. no doubt, best UI design for e-commerce website is the one which leaves a buyer happy and brings profits to the stakeholders.

# take it easy: tips for effort-saving user interface

simplicity is the ultimate sophistication, said genius Leonardo da Vinci, and this eternal truth is as fair now as it was several centuries ago. such an approach in design for web and mobile interfaces results in human centered products which are pleasant and easy in use. make no mistake, simple doesn't mean empty, primitive or mono-functional. instead, it means clear, intuitive and helpful. really simple products not only solve user's problems but also do it in an optimal way in the aspects of times and effort.

we aren't often thinking in terms of love and respect when it comes to digital products. we can describe them in tons of other words featuring appearance like beautiful, elegant, interesting etc. or functionality like intuitive, easy to use, confusing etc. or content like informative, consistent etc. but you rarely can hear that someone names a website or app respectful. however, repect ofr user's time and energy is one of the vital goals which designers should strive to achieve in the product they work on. this approach is a great factor of usability and desirability. today we would like to share some advice and techniques which could be come supportive of this aim. these tips aren't reinventing the wheel but present a helpful checklist for design outcome. so, let's check what designers can do to save time and effort for users.

## 1. put the core data into header

talking about websites, it is an extremely helpful idea for quick and easy navigation. the only problem is to decide on what core data is, especially for websites with a huge amount of various data, like big e-commerce websites, news platforms or multi-theme blogs. header is a strategic part as people see it before scrolling the page in the first seconds of introduction to the website. being a sign of invitation, header should provide the key information about the digital product so that users could scan it in split seconds.

in our article telling about web headers design in detail, we provided the typical kinds of content which can be included into headers:

1. basic elements of brand identity: logo, brand name lettering, slogan or company statement, corporate mascot, photo presenting the company or its leader, corporate colors etc.
2. copy block setting the theme of the product or service presented 
3. links to basic categories of website content
4. links to the most important social networks
5. basic contact information
6. switcher of the languages in case of multi-lingual interface
7. search field
8. subscription field
9. links to interaction with the product such as trial version, downloading from the app store etc.



it doesn't mean that all the mentioned elements should be included in one web page header: in this case, the risk is high that the header section would be overloaded with information. the more objects attract user's attention, the harder it is to concentrate on the vital ones. here designers, preferably together with marketing specialists and stakeholders, need to decide on the strategically important options and pick them up from the list or add the others.

why is header so essential? eye-tracking investigations show that whichever scanning mode a particular user follows, the scanning precess will start in the top horizontal area of the web page. using it for showing the core information and branding is a strategy supporting both sides: readers scan the key data quickly while website gets the chance to retain them if it's presented properly. that is the basic reason why header design is an essential issue for UIUX designers as well as content and promotion specialists.

## 2. make branding highly visual

in terms of the discussed topic, brand means a sort of image created via a set of distinguishing features and promoting awareness and recognizability of the product or service on the market. this image can be created in tons of diverse ways. visual, verbal, touchable etc. in web and mobile design, branding supposedly means a set of visual elements defining the brand style, which can be applied in the interfaces such as logo, typography, brand colors and the like. all of them together are a powerful tool for creating visual recognizability of the product as well as its style. being based on the analysis of target audience and marketing customer research, branding in this sense plays the vital role in product promotion as visual perception is very fast and easy for most people, much easier than reading the text and much more memorable than listening to speech. moreover, if the brand is already well established, its signs observed in the first seconds of seeing a website or app increase the level of trust.

## 3. use numbers, not words

one of the investigations of user behavior provided by Nielsen Norman Blog shared an interesting finding: based on eye-tracking studies while users scan web pages, numerals often stop the wandering eye and attract fixations, even when they are embedded within a mass of words that users otherwise ignore. people subconsciously associate numbers with facts, stats, sizes and distance something potentially useful for them. so they are hooked with the numbers included in copy while words representing numbers represent, they are more compact than their textual variant, which enables to make the content more concise and time saving for skimming the data.

##4. make the call to action instantly noticeable

a call to action is actually a word of phrase stimulating users to interact with a product in a way and for the aim it is designed for. CTA elements are the interactive controls which enable users to do the action they are called to. common types of such interactive elements in the layout are buttons, tabs, or links. in the interfaces of all kinds, CTA elements are the interactive controls which enable users to do the action they are called to. common types of such interactive elements in the layout are buttons,

# UX Design for B2B: Businesslike Strategies and Tips.

User experience design for business is getting more and more expressions today. A great diversity of companies make an important decision to come into play and fight for online presence. Various services are now available and executed online. In these conditions, designers working on the projects in this perspective, have to keep in mind the variety of business relations to offer the solutions corresponding the specific client’s goals. Continuing the theme of creating web and mobile products, today we suggest discussing the issues of design for the sphere of B2B services.

## What is B2B?

 

B2B is the term used in business, marketing and economy to mark the relations of the sides in the business process like «business-to-business». B2B means that one company provides products or services aimed at the other companies’ business activities. The target audience of the offer is not individual customers but businesses. The nature of relations has a direct impact on business process, strategy, promotion and therefore any design stages involved in this scope. Not going far, if we are talking about outsourced design and development services, they are a direct example of B2B.

To get this example deeper, let’s imagine the company which sells physical goods to end consumers, let’s say, casual clothes. They need a website which will provide quite broad functionality for a big amount of users. The stakeholders monitor the market for web services and find out that hiring an outsource company for design and development is cheaper and more convenient for them than creating an in-company department for this purpose. This is the start of B2B relations as a digital agency provides their services for another business — a clothes shop — so that it could start e-commerce activity.

 

People involved in the design process for products and services have to consider the types of relations chosen for the particular project. Actually, the type of business scheme initially defines the target audience and nature of interactions which are key factors for efficient and user-friendly design solutions. Designing for business should supposedly involve methods of visual and content presentation which are different from the one presented directly to end users. It’s easy to see by examples of numerous landing pages: the ones aimed at companies use content, language, visual and graphic elements, placement of data blocks different from those which are targeted at individual buyers or users.

 

Neglecting the aspect of business relations increases the risk of creating the design which will not provide high conversion rate even being sophisticated, stylish and attractive visually. The psychological background behind design solutions has to support a particular business schemes or strategy. Here in Tubik, we have had broad experience of design for all the mentioned schemes so below you will find some ideas we would like to share on the basis of that practice.

## Aspects to consider in design for B2B

 

Designing for B2B, it’s important to remember that:

— design solutions should consistently strengthen branding and company policy. The quality of design says much to the potential clients which the interface has to attract. A good dress is a card of invitation, a good mind is a letter of recommendation — it worked years ago and it still works now. Quality of design created for a website of B2B service is actually an integral part of their image and therefore profits. Remember, that B2B differs from B2C: the stakes, as well as the expenses, are higher, the number of leads can be limited with the specific nature of services, the decisions about the deal may take weeks and even month before they are agreed upon. The website or app design must present the company or service as highly-professional from the first seconds of the interaction and visual perception.  It should build a reliable bridge between the sides looking for collaboration. That’s why businessmen in this sphere are recommended to involve professional designers into the process while designers have to do their best to understand the business goals and research target audience.

 

— people become more and more open and sociable, not only in personal but also in professional aspects, and social networks present the great ground for that aim. Implementation of design elements in social network marketing of B2B company, using the same style, voice, corporate colors and graphics, specially designed branded items and the like is one more way to strengthen brand awareness by means of design. Design has to be consistent whenever the B2B company is presented: headers and banners, logos, style of photos in social network account and on the website need to feature the same stylistic approach. In this way, design makes branding more recognizable, comprehensive and solid.

 

— consistent and a thought-out content strategy combining visual and textual material with the careful selection of visuals and copy is able to fulfill all the stages of sales funnel and bring better conversion of the website, landing page or application of B2B company;

 

— concise and minimalistic solutions in design and copywriting work efficiently in most cases because they save time and effort of busy stakeholders and entrepreneurs. The effective variant of scenario can take place when they are given concise core information at the first stage of interaction but always have the chance to read more if they are interested (as well as avoid reading huge copy blocks if they don’t want). Certainly, this solution should be based on thorough user research, but it has a high potential to make user experience positive;

 

— business is done differently in different countries. It should be always considered together with the nature of business relations as the factor making a considerable impact on the level of trust and wish to collaborate. Selection of graphic content and layout of the elements on the screen or page should go under analysis in this perspective as some graphic elements, photos, gestures, word combinations, color choices which are efficient and clear for one region or culture can be totally unacceptable or even offensive for the others. Creation of several landing pages targeted locally can be an effective solution;

 

— the aim of a website or other piece of design presenting B2B company is not to grow a huge flow of traffic but to engage and direct leads which belong to the target audience and are potentially open to take part in business collaboration or partnership good for both sides. It’s important to keep in mind that retaining customers, in this case, plays not less role than involving them in the game.

## Design strategies for B2B

 

The strategies mentioned below may work not only for B2B but for any kind of interfaces aimed at business. Still, in B2B their role in getting profit may be more significant.

 

**Get CTA elements seen instantly.** Call-to-action buttons should be perfectly visible. Doesn’t it work that way for any kind of website, not only B2B? Yes, you are right. But in B2B the price of a click is much higher while visitors are often horribly busy and don’t tend to spend much time looking for a button on the page. Apply color, shape or orientation contrast, test the most effective placement and think over the copy on it — all that stuff may have a crucial effect on conversion rates.

 

**Make value proposition noticeable**. Getting to the website, the visitors should immediately understand why it is beneficial to them. Don’t make them search for the reason to cooperate with this B2B service — they won’t do it. Use the catchy slogan or tagline which will express the value proposition briefly and clearly, and take care of its visual performance. Typographic hierarchy will help user’s eye to catch it first, appropriate fonts will add the mood and style to the message.

 

**Don’t overwhelm users with information: prioritize content.** There is a big temptation for a business to show all its strong sides at maximum. However, it may lead to the website with a huge amount of data which might get the visitor confused, annoyed or frightened. It is especially hard in the cases when visual hierarchy isn’t thought-out and tested properly: the pages risk transforming into a mess which cannot be scanned quickly. So, prioritization is both designer’s and user’s friend here: apply design techniques and layout which will strengthen the visual performance of the core information.

 

**Make copy blocks digestible**. The debates around the theme of copy blocks are still hot and actual: which copy is better, long or short? Actually, both may be effective. As we mentioned in the article devoted to landing pages, a decision on the amount of copy has to be based on thorough research and testing as it directly and highly influences conversions.  For example, if it presents a famous company product or service or informs about special offers, sometimes short and concise copy is enough to encourage users to buy or know more. However, if a new unknown product or service is presented, it may be important to provide users with more information persuading them to follow the call to action. Whatever is the decision, the copy content should be given in scannable blocks which aren’t too big so that the user didn’t think reading will take too much time. Scanning the blocks allows for faster understanding if the copy brings useful information.

 

**Keep core data available from the pre-scroll area.** Users usually decide on staying on the website or leaving it very quickly. It is really a matter of minutes or even seconds. That is why all the key information would better be seen in the pre-scroll area, including the value proposition and ability to contact the duty holders. 

 

**Activate the power of color psychology.** Colors present the great support in sending the right message. Being attentive to target audience’s preferences, designers can select the colors not only on the basis of their nice looks but also color psychology which explains associations people have with colors.

 

**Apply catchy visuals sending a message.** A picture is worth a thousand words — and that’s not just because it’s more appealing or beautiful but also because in the vast majority of cases, it is perceived faster than words. Moreover, the attractive visual content, be it a photo, illustration or poster may become another source of informing the user about the value proposition provided by the company.

 

**Consider promo video content.** Promo videos present the popular trend in business schemes now as they enable to inform users about the value propositions and benefits in the fast and original way. However, it may influence the loading speed of the page so this decision needs to be well-weighed.

 

**Apply landing pages for special offers.** Landing pages allow for focusing user’s attention on the specific information instead of making them search for it around the website. It is especially important is the sales funnel starts out of the website.

 

**Don’t forget about the testimonials and signs of trust. **Word-of-mouth is the best advertising, especially in the B2B sphere. Making a decision on collaboration, people tend to consider references, testimonials and other signs of trust from the previous clients as positive factors. So, make sure they are available and easily found.

 

**Let users contact duty holders from any point of their journey. **Contacts can be presented in various formats. They can reveal the data such as phone number and location, emails, links to messengers, contact forms and instant chat window. Making the phone numbers clickable is supportive as many users now browse from their smartphones and may want to call right from there. The address can be also clickable opening the screenshot or map showing how to find the location. The solutions have to be based on thoughtful user research setting target audience’s expectations, level of tech literacy and the most convenient ways of contact for them. 



Hopefully, the mentioned strategies will help not only designers but also entrepreneurs who want to know more about design issues influencing profitability. Soon, we will share more posts devoted to other numerous aspects of design for business.

Good food is good mood — for most people that has been true for decades and centuries. Taking up the big part of human time and activity, no wonder food became one of the hot topics in tech progress. There is a whole bunch of mobile and web interfaces solving a diversity of problems connected with food: websites and applications for cafes and restaurants, recipe apps and social networks, food ordering and food delivery apps. Whatever is the goal behind UI design for a food app, that’s cool when it’s not only helpful but also delicious and attractive.

 

Earlier we have already shared numerous ideas on interface design for this theme. Today let us present a fresh food app design case study, this time concentrated on several recipe card concepts. In this project, Tubik designers Anton Morozov, Ernest Asanov and Vlad Taran took a chance of UI experiments and analysis for a variety of approaches to content and navigation of recipe cards.

 

## Project

 

UI design of a mobile application on cooking and recipes

 

## Introduction

 

In general terms, the designers got the task to design a food app for users who love cooking. It included the recipe database which was constantly updated. Also, the application had a supplies manager. To make UX more extended, it allowed users to find the recipes on the basis of the supplies they currently had at home or create a shopping list to buy ingredients that were missing.

 

According to the brief which presented the client’s preferences, the food app design had to include the following functionality.

**Required Features**

\1. Search bar
\2. Filter button (Information about the number of results and applied filters)
\3. Recipe cards (Recipe picture + Title)

**Optional Ideas**

• Ratio of ingredients you have to the total number the recipe requires
• Cook time
• Calories
• X button to hide that recipe and show fewer recipes like that
• Add to shopping list button
• Like / save button
• Recipe author and his/her profile picture
• Review score
• Favorite count
• Main ingredients
• Share
• Direct link to view the recipe source
• Consider what type of layout for the recipe feed will work best, grid vs single column.

 

## Problem

 

The client provided the team with a lot of information and ideas on the main screen. The designers had to analyze and prioritize all the points, as there was a high risk of overloading the screen. On the basis of research and analysis, the user scenarios were created to determine which information about the meal in the recipe is found the most important.

 

## Solutions exploration: benefits and pitfalls

 

The designers worked out several options for recipe cards presentation which would effectively present the core data on the limited space of a mobile screen. Considering that the recipe card presented the key element of interaction in this app, the final decision had to be grounded on the balance of logic and emotion, effective navigation and aesthetic satisfaction. Having tried different directions, the designers defined three various options of content and controls placement in the layout.  Among them, the creative team had to choose the variant corresponding to target audience expectations. Here are the options.

 

### а) Recipes shown as a list

 

**Benefits**: more content can be shown on the screen.

**Pitfalls**: the photo content looks too small.

 

### b) Recipes shown as cards (like Pinterest)

 

**Benefits**: the dynamic height of the cards allows for placing photos of any layout metrics and headlines of any length

 

**Pitfalls**: the column for notes and additional elements is too narrow. Card manipulations such as adding ingredients into the shopping list, hiding the similar recipes and sharing the recipes to social networks led to applying the long press/force touch which was not the most obvious solutions for users

 

### c) Big recipe cards

 

**Benefits**: photo content attracts maximum attention

**Pitfalls**: the screen features only one recipe, the additional functionality still isn’t obvious for users.

 

## Final solution

 

The creative team preferred the emotional variant. Coming out to the market, the product has to be ultimately attractive. That will enable to collect the feedback and analytics data which can be used as a basis for the next stage of the creative search for solutions enhancing user experience. Unobtrusive and elegant animation during the first interaction will prompt about the additional functionality that is hidden under the card and available on swipe down.

 

## Additional details: filters placement

 

The filter panel allows a user to sort out the list of recipes. The user can apply pre-sets: for example the preset “cook” shows only the recipes based on the ingredients currently available for the user. Also, the filters can be manually customized. The panel is placed in the bottom part of the screen to add more convenience to the operations with the app by one hand.

 

## Bottom line

 

In Apple, they say: “…the first thing we ask is what do we want people to feel?” Not everyone considers the issues connected to users’ feelings and emotions before they start creating a new digital product. Today most designers strive for functionality. However, when people’s feelings and emotions become a priority, the product gets the features and details which let the users love it.

本人比较喜欢研究各种各样的App，下载使用过的应用更是不下900款，但是最终保留的App少之又少，这是为什么呢？通过多次分析得出结论，以下文章将围绕用户需求，产品价值以及用户体验等宏观维度为大家解析这个问题。

首先来回答一个问题：驱使用户下载app的条件有哪些？

- 日常需求
- 解决痛点
- 好奇心
- 同行业学习
- 朋友推荐
- 颜值高
- 子产品
- ……

用户下载你的app理由非常之多，但是为什么最终会卸载你的软件呢？

#### **一. 用户需求点（Demands）**

- 需求
- 刚需
- 痛点

从一张图来看三者关系：

![img](http://image.uisdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/uisdc-uninstallreason-20180211-1.jpg)

**什么是需求？**

传统需求指商品供求关系中受价格影响较小的需求，这些商品包括日常生活用品、家用耐耗品等等。也可理解为人们日常生活中常见的商品和必需品。在互联网中需求更多指的是人们需要的功能与内容。

例如，用户需要一款可以聊天的软件，用户需要一款可以看电影的软件，用户需要一款可以修图的软件，这些都是需求。

需求一般由用户产生，「存在即是合理的」，产品所要做的无非就是提供满足用户需求的产品及功能点。

**什么是刚需？**

从互联网角度来看，用户想要的功能与内容，都可以称之为需求。当需求非常强烈，甚至非要不可，就可以称之为刚需，也叫刚性需求。

刚需对立面叫「非刚需」，也有互联网人称为「软需」，即非必要的功能内容。但是这里要注意，某些非刚需可以在一定条件下转变为刚需。

**什么是痛点？**

在解决需求时，往往会遇见阻碍，比如时间、金钱、难易程度。这些阻碍用户或产品的问题就是痛点。当解决问题的阻碍越大时，痛点越强烈。痛点也称为难点。

在使用产品过程中，经常让我头疼的点，就是一些产品不能很好的定位自己。比如仅仅是一款工具类软件，不存在社交功能点与付费功能，但是还是需要你注册登录才能使用。

举个例子来总结他们之间的关系：

最近上班很疲惫，想去旅游，所以来到了夏威夷海摊，想去旅游就是需求。只是想去旅游，但是可能会因为旅游的价格，假期的长短而影响这次旅游会不会实现。

到达夏威夷沙滩后，发现一天没喝水好渴，这就是刚需，是当前渴望非常强烈，非要不可的需求。

但是我发现卖水的店有两家，一家离我非常远价格便宜，一家在附近价值却是3倍，这就是痛点。

作为产品本身要考虑自己为用户解决了什么？当用户觉得你可有可无的时候，要么你就已经被打入「冷宫」，要么就直接挥手告别了。

#### **二. 产品价值（Value）**

这里为什么会提到产品价值，产品价值是由产品的功能、特性、内容等所产生的价值 ，是用户需要的中心内容。产品价值是由用户需要来决定的。产品价值包括用户价值与商业价值。

产品价值涉及层面很多，包括产品定位、产品业务范围、用户认同感、用户信赖度等等。

如何判断产品是否存在用户价值？

- 用户需求
- 用户体验
- 情感维系

我想围绕以上三点来讲解产品用户价值，一般可以说明一款产品的价值所在。商业价值主要集中在价值变现，这里先不做解释。

用户需求与用户体验在上下文都有做解析，情感维系这个比较贴近于运营相关，比如近几年火爆起来的短视频行业与二次元行业，都是有着情感维系这点的体现。

产品受众人群是有一定的文化基础与兴趣爱好，他们渴望结交同类人群，渴望被他人关注，而微博、Facebook、微信等产品的成功也恰恰是离不开这一点，它们已然转化成为日常生活的一部分。除了维系用户群间的关系，产品还需要维系平台与用户的关系，平台对于用户来说是什么？是很多产品人必须认真思考的问题。

比如知乎的成功之路，知乎产品的成功离不开对于自身产品的准确定位，平台对于用户来说是什么？面对来自百度贴吧的压力，知乎竟然脱颖而出，打造出一款高质量的问答产品。

用户感情是脆弱的，他们在使用产品过程中可能会碰到许多问题，产品更应该为用户引导，解决问题，如支付宝与微信的用户情感维系就非常不错。

![img](http://image.uisdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/uisdc-uninstallreason-20180211-2.jpg)

作用：维系产品与用户、用户与用户之间的联系，社会本身就是一个大的社交圈，任何人都不可能脱离群体而独活。

好的产品有自身的产品价值来吸引用户下载使用，好的产品也会对用户形成品牌认同感与信赖感。

#### **三. 用户体验（UX）**

从视觉、交互、性能等方面来为大家解释这个问题。

![img](http://image.uisdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/uisdc-uninstallreason-20180211-3.jpg)

**视觉体验（Interface）——长得丑**

这是个「看脸」的时代，各行各业都是如此。正如你去看车展，身材好外貌佳的车模周围肯定是闪光不断。宜家产品为什么那么受欢迎，有很多因素，而我最喜欢的就是宜家产品的颜值高。大众的眼睛是雪亮的，也是挑剔的，应及时抛弃旧设计，紧追设计潮流。

这里也要涉及「第一印象效应」，第一印象是指第一次接触时在对方脑中能占据主导位置，从而有着主导权优势，所以有多重要请斟酌。

**注册登录（Flow）——流程繁琐，要求复杂**

登录注册流程这一块非常重要，当刚接触APP的时候，发现许多APP参考PC端的那一套，甚至直接整个流程搬过来，这种做法是非常不可取的z。

**内容质量（Quality）——内容质量太差**

集中体现在资讯类、学习类产品中，这类产品的用户群都是为了寻求知识或者乐趣而来。OGC原本是该类平台核心，不过后面经由PGC后，到UGC都是一个平台的发展过程，互联网创业者建议多阅读与学习「如何让用户产出内容」。

**交互体验（Interaction）——难学习、难理解**

体验过不少APP，有些产品真的惨不忍睹，巴不得把所有功能都实现，巴不得把市面上所有优秀的产品的功能点都抄过来，其结果会导致产品内容复杂，产品逻辑紊乱，最终用户可能会因为太难上手而抛弃产品。

「简约之上」主义在日本设计领域享有盛名，其核心是让用户享受，而非让用户学习，易用性也是ios设计原则中的一点。

**用户期盼（Expect）——不能达到用户预期，或缺失用户想要的内容功能点**

很容易理解：

- 你下载QQ和微信是为了什么？聊天啊。
- 你下载人人都是产品经理app为了什么？学习干货啊。
- 你下载王者荣耀为了什么？玩游戏啊。
- 你买iphoneX是为了什么？装13啊（这点纯属娱乐）
- ……

以上是表层下载需求，那么深层需求是什么?

- “我的好朋友都在里面，可以随时联系。”
- “我想成为一名产品经理。”
- “朋友们都在玩，听说挺好玩。”
- “想体验苹果的全面屏与脸部识别”
- “……”

这是用户的心理预期，但是会造成用户失望的行为是什么？

- “我朋友都不玩了，所以我也不玩了。”
- “里面没有我想要的干货。”
- “脸部识别技术不够完善。”
- ……

以上纯属举例，不喜勿喷。但是当用户的期盼值为0时，产品的存在也就显得无足轻重。

**性能体验（Performance）——跑流量、耗电快、占内存、不流畅**

这里也把性能体验放上来，主要原因是如今的移动端与PC端硬件设施不断升级，基本上已经满足用户的需求，在硬件已经日趋完善的情况下，软件也需要「了解」用户。

QQ为满足不同人群需求，也相应推出了QQ国际版、TIM等软件，微博也为了照顾部分用户，推出微博国际版，侧面缓解了手机内存压力的用户，赢得不少赞赏。

**提示消息（Messeage）——推送消息/广告过多，更新过频**

你肯定有见过一天推送好几篇通知的app吧，其实这里不得不提下资讯类与视频类应用。在某资讯类应用中，一天的通知消息多达5条。就我而言，一天接到的通知消息包括社交平台、资讯平台、理财平台、娱乐平台，每个平台还有多款应用。如果产品为了引起用户关注而频发通知，估计只有被禁用通知消息的下场。

首先，推送通知要对用户有用（大热点、大更新、大干货），其次不可以过频，比如版本迭代，产品经理更应该把控好产品迭代周期，尽量避免频频更新，但是却没有什么亮点。

最后是广告的植入，广告在产品的植入方式多种多样，据调查，用户最无法忍受的是无法关闭的广告，影响视觉体验，更影响操作行为，所以要慎重。

**用户反馈（Feedback）——心声无法得到回应**

在用户使用产品过程中，多多少少都会碰到问题。服务类型软件都必须存在「客服和反馈」模块，这里被人诟病的有摩拜，我也是经历过好几次体验问题，在客户端反馈无果，也联系不到客服。反观苹果的售后服务体验就非常不错，具体就不做说明。这里要提的是能及时听取用户反馈，既能帮助完善产品体验，又能优化品牌形象。

**隐私安全（Privary）**

iOS系统对于产品调动某些权限管理比较严，这是非常不错的，但是应用本身还是会要求要读取用户的隐私数据。比如前几年非常火的H5活动页，许多活动都会要求读取用户的头像与信息数据，还有的需要读取用户地理位置，填写用户电话号码，甚至是身份证信息，这就涉及到用户的隐私安全问题。

现在的用户群大部分围绕在90、00后，他们对于互联网的敏锐度越来越高，不合理的要求可能会导致用户对产品失望。

比如，你的产品是一款修图产品，却想要读取用户的地理位置，那么绝大部分用户会反感。

#### **四. 总结**

产品就应该不违背初心，不忽略用户。

很多时候产品从起步之后就开始变味，商业手段泛滥，不考虑用户的产品体验，商业目的太重的产品注定失败。从产品上线到实现商业价值是一个漫长的路，一路上产品与用户是息息相关的。

用户为什么会卸载你的App？其实无非就是你的产品抛弃了用户。

过去的2017年被誉为“新零售元年”从早前的颜艳春的《第三次零售革命》到阿里的“五新”战略，再到京东的“新零售革命”等等一系列关于“新零售”的概念被正式提出。而行动上无论是互联网电商巨头，还是传统线下零售企业均在紧锣密鼓地展开因应此次零售变革布的布局。此次“新零售”变革概念从中国提出之时，从全球范围来看，和传统零售形态不太一样的商业形态和消费者体验已经在世界各地慢慢的生长起来。

这一年中各式各样关于“新零售”的热点事件层出不穷。可以确信的是从2017年开始，在零售范畴内新的商业模式将不断推陈出新，我们的生活与购买方式也将发生巨变。

商业活动的参与者以及商业形式纷繁复杂，而商业目的最终指向的还是消费者（用户）。而作为用户体验设计从业者，需紧更时代变革，从自身专业角度去认知、观察“新零售”业态和现象，扩大视野。在新的商业边界不断拓展的时代进程中，分析、观察新商业环境下衍生出的用户体验新场景、新情况、新问题。从去年4月开始国际UED内贸零售通项目组聚焦“新零售”话题，开展了一个早读课接力的活动，截止目前，我们共收集了60多篇全球范围内有关“新零售”方面的案例、分析、评论文章。通过文字、视频等资讯，看到了一个生机勃勃的新商业景象，和一大批精彩纷呈的生动案例，它们各自专有所长，有的光彩熠熠。

为更能概念化、结构化的去认知形态各异，精彩纷呈的新零售业态，以及各自背后产生的用户体验问题和各自的解决方案，本文将目前新零售业态归纳成三种类型：

数据智能与极致效率型、创新技术体验型，和场景/理念创新型（划分维度并不表示该商家只具备他所在类型的能力，而是所在分类是其比较突出或核心的能力）

![img](http://image.uisdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/uisdc-newretail-20180211-1.jpg)

下面我将对上述归纳的3类新零售类型中的典型案例逐一展开介绍，观察分析，探索。

#### **一. 数据智能和极致效率型**

案例1、以7-Eleven为典型代表的连锁便利店，和之后的一些商超。虽然他们并非在这轮“新零售”热潮出现时才诞生，但是其强大的以数据驱动的客户服务能力是“新零售”业态可以借鉴的超级样本。 7-11有强大的客户数据收集和精准分析能力，并能高效的管理经营数据，使得他能始终紧贴消费者需求变化，在商品不断推陈出新的过程中能保持低库存，同时配合先进的物流系统与门店及网络系统，降低供应链成本，因此就能够为消费者提供物美质优且有差异化的商品。

![img](http://image.uisdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/uisdc-newretail-20180211-2.jpg)

另外7-11通过其广布的门店，深度服务消费者生活周边，从缴费、充值、购票到复印、取款收寄快递可谓是无所不能，做到极致。另外店内货品陈设、动线规划贴心且科学的布设也是其成功不可或缺的方面。

![img](http://image.uisdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/uisdc-newretail-20180211-3.jpg)

案例2、小米也是最早提出“新零售”概念的厂商之一， “小米之家”通过提供产品展示、科技体验、增值服务、商品销售、社交互动，满足消费者智能物联、消费升级、极客酷玩等需求的智能科技产品平台，小米之家用10余大类200多种sku组合（小米生态链的产品）覆盖消费者个人和家庭生活环境，以及办公、出行、游玩等场景把一个低频单一的旗舰电子产品消费场景变成了一个高频消费场景。另外通过线上线下同品同价，使得目前“小米之家”的坪效位居世界第二，仅次于APPLE零售店。成为极致效率新零售概念的典型代表。

![img](http://image.uisdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/uisdc-newretail-20180211-4.jpg)

观察：这类业态提到的2个案例均是极致效率的典范，但行业、业态类型商业模式完全不同，一个是通过数据提升商家自身效率的同时更是通过数据识别、洞察从而高效、精准的服务好消费者。另一点是融合线上与线下各自优势，通过关联生态产品系和优质的长尾服务提升商家自身效率，同时给消费者带来线上线下自由优质体验的。但相同的是二者都将自身实现极致效率的商业模式与向用户提供精准、优质、高效的产品和服务这两面，以最优方式紧密的捆绑融合成为了一体。

#### **二. 创新技术体验型**

案例1、旧金山的Eatsa餐厅从传统用餐模式中摸索出来的彻底改造。“无店员”概念，运营轻量化，快餐定时且可个性化，低卡健康，低价，高效，游戏化模式（取餐过程，音乐），给用户营造了无人餐饮的氛围的同时人们吃饭时等待的时间大大减少。 系统化点餐送餐，“无店员沟通环节”有测算Eatsa平均每人点餐时间为约2分钟，每分钟平均有6-7份餐点做好被送到格子里被顾客取走，就餐高峰一家店每天能售出将近1000份食物。

![img](http://image.uisdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/uisdc-newretail-20180211-5.jpg)

案例2、最近刚刚正式运营的Amazon Go是近期以技术驱动的无人新零售店的标杆型案例，亚马逊通过计算机视觉、感应器整合、深度学习，消费者在店内从货架上取下的任何商品都会被店内部署的摄像头和传感器系统自动识别并添加到对应的亚马逊线上购物车中。如果把手提袋里的商品放回到货架上，购物车里对应的商店也会被自动删除。 购物结束后走出店外，Amazon Go 会通过已经绑定的银行卡自动结账。同时手机 App 里也会将此次购物的详细清单列出来。购物过程顾客完全省去了排队、结账流程。

![img](http://image.uisdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/uisdc-newretail-20180211-6.jpg)

案例3、一种以缤果盒子、F5未来商店、EATBOX等为代表的轻量级技术型。核心理念是用机械臂、RFID自动识别等技术代替人提供服务，这种模式更多是以产品可快速复制，商业拓展迅速为出发点，一方面优势在于设备布设灵活，能比街边门店更加贴近消费者。另外新技术的应用在节省商家成本的同时，也给消费者节省时间，生活上带来便利。

![img](http://image.uisdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/uisdc-newretail-20180211-7.jpg)

案例4、日本佐贺牛采用现代声光电和虚拟现实VR／AR技术，应用在餐厅环境中，采用线上预约时间方式，从顾客进入餐厅，到点菜、上餐过程都有相应多媒体视听效果（艺术动画、当料理与器皿被放置在在桌上时，原本浓缩封闭在那个料理与器皿内的世界会被解放出来，然後延展到桌子以及整个空间里。）在顾客就餐的同时，给顾客带来以全新的感官享受和奇幻般的试听、味蕾旅程。

![img](http://image.uisdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/uisdc-newretail-20180211-8.jpg)

观察：技术升级与引入将助推新零售不断进步，综合技术+场景化体验：数字营销、移动终端、社交媒体、电商、及店内数字艺术、娱乐技术 物联网技术、人脸识别技术、以及移动支付技术均悉数登场。商家将应用这些技术围绕用户体验进行业态升级，不管是新的智慧门店还是新的互动体验，都将与过去完全不同。从以上的案例来看，商家业态的核心并非技术，仍是用户体验和价值。如何将眼花缭乱的技术更高效、精准、友好而富有情感的服务好消费者，恰当的创新性的运用新技术，让成本最优、效率最大化的情况下给用户带来真真切切的价值（节省获取商品、排队时间）产生更好的体验（感受科技便捷，获得满足感与身心的愉悦） 始终是“新零售”的主题。

#### **三. 场景、理念创新型**

第三大类型里还包含了两种场景创新型：

一类是在传统的集中、固定空间的卖场中试图向人们传递新消费观念、生活理念和营造独特氛围，这类型最早可以从星巴克的“第三空间”找到源头，星巴克期望把他的咖啡店打造成人们除家庭和办公室之外的第三个生活空间，有如繁花都市中的一个小绿洲，让奔波于家庭和办公室之间的现代人有个落脚转换的“第三空间”。

另一类是商家会把自动或开放的无人货架安置进办公大楼，和移动的出租汽车等原来从不会认为是“卖场”的新空间中，而这些地方可能恰恰有着对某些快消品类（零食、水饮）大量多频次的需求。

案例1、EATALY：慢生活超市餐厅，通过倡导和培养消费者的慢生活意识，综合了超市和餐厅两种属性，在门店的布置上独具匠心。超市的旁边就是厨房，确保了食材的新鲜程度，又能向购买商品的顾客演示如何回家料理，一举两得。结账柜台就在超市入口处，无需逛完整个店就能结账，关联食材酒饮的货架搭配等细节之处十分用心。另外还有其社交媒体的宣传策略、店内美食烹饪讲座、邀请儿童互动参观厨房在消费者心中营造独特的品牌亲和力。

![img](http://image.uisdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/uisdc-newretail-20180211-9.jpg)

![img](http://image.uisdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/uisdc-newretail-20180211-10.jpg)

案例2、盒马鲜生希望在生鲜垂直类目下向消费者传递新的消费价值观：这套消费观念包括：

“新鲜每一刻” 每天的商品都是新鲜的小包装，倡导当天吃完，餐桌上需要什么随时可以在盒马买到，每天吃当天新鲜食材。将来可能你家里的冰箱都不再需要了；

“所想即所得” 消费者可以随时随地在盒马App线上移动下单，线上线下同品质同价格，满足人门在不同场景下随时随地的需求。盒马的仓储物流作业前置到门店，和门店共享库存和物流基础设施，店内高效的自动化物流设备自动分拣商品，基本能达到5公里内30分半钟送达的及时配送承诺；

“一站式购物” 盒马鲜生是围绕吃来定位的，满足所有吃的问题。除门店有限的空间外，盒马还通过线上渠道扩展商品品类；按全渠道经营的理念设计，完美实现了线上和线下的全渠道整合。

“让吃变得快乐，让做饭成为娱乐” 对于场景的精准切入，仅以三餐作为其消费场景，因此所有的SKU，生鲜，鲜食，加工或常规，全部都是围绕餐桌。顾客在店内选购了海鲜等食材之后可提供厨房，即买即烹，现场制作品尝，店里还设置了大量的分享、DIY、交流等等。让“吃”这件事变成娱乐、变成快乐，消费者就会产生强烈的黏性。

![img](http://image.uisdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/uisdc-newretail-20180211-11.jpg)

案例3、星巴克上海烘焙工坊里，增强现实技术（AR）是一大亮点，用户在门店使用手机淘宝“扫一扫”的“AR扫一眼”功能，就能获得一些原本看不到的信息，比如商店正中的那个大铜罐有什么用、主吧台上的那些设备到底做什么的，等等；但现流行的“扫一扫”自助点单等功能却没有出现。这并不是没有技术条件，而是星巴克认为点单应由消费者和伙伴（星巴克对工作人员的称呼）面对面完成，这是星巴克服务的一大特色，虽然自助点单可以提高效率，却会让门店失去交流的温度。

![img](http://image.uisdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/uisdc-newretail-20180211-12.jpg)

案例4、纽约的Warby Parker眼镜店在店内装饰着各类插画，不变的是，两家店的第二主角都是书。眼镜下方陈列和空间中都摆放着书籍，挑选的红色或者蓝色封面的书籍对应旗舰店的设计。Warby Parker 从第一家旗舰店开始，书籍就是室内装饰很重要的一部分，纽约SOHO的店，看起来像一个纽约公立图书馆。

另一个时尚品牌Sonia Rykiel，一直以文学为灵感，书籍一直是 Sonia Rykiel 品牌的特色。在巴黎左岸的旗舰店，书架从天花板一直到地板，多达五万本。设计师的衣服嵌在密密麻麻的书籍中，给人明显的视觉冲击。不过 Sonia Rykiel 里的书不卖。这两个品牌不是随便挑了一个设计概念，文学是他们品牌基因中的一部分。商家认为时尚和文学是生命中没法儿分开的两个东西。对于想要增加零售体验的时尚品牌，在前往生活方式店的方向上，光开咖啡馆显的不够有诚意，卖书成了一些品牌的选择。

![img](http://image.uisdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/uisdc-newretail-20180211-13.jpg)

案例5、近期遍布各办公大楼甚至交通工具上的无人货架成为新零售的一个热点。目前国内市场上有e微店、老虎快购、果小美、哈米科技、猩便利、零食e家、领蛙、七只考拉等多家无人货架创业项目。很多人认为“无人”货架并不是什么新鲜的概念，其实就是在地铁、商场等公共场所随处可见的自动售后机。最早是投币购物，后来逐渐出现可以扫码通过第三方支付的付款方式。先不讨论其商业模式目前的一些困境与前景如何，目前的植入式的无人货架秉持的是需求决定，用户的需求在哪，零售的终端形态就在哪。 有别于前面一类的是无人货架是“货”进入原来不是“场”的一些“新场”而这些“新场”是与目标用户关系更为密切，空间距离更加贴近，且与目标用户“相处”时间更长，可谓是低头不见抬头见。相同产品、价格差异不大情况下，更近意味着更容易被选择。

![img](http://image.uisdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/uisdc-newretail-20180211-14.jpg)

观察：从这类新零售业态可以看出，新的理念、新消费观的塑造和价值传递，将是未来商业一个非常重要的方面和商家的核心能力之一。随着城市化进程和居民生活水平提升，除对物质有更高要求，商家通过理念构建和服务设计，去满足居民在精神层面的追求将是新零售面对的一个课题和机会。 而新场景的无人货架零售方式是几年的一个热点，而新场景的开辟，在货架的布设地点，商品选品匹配度、商品陈列，补货及时性和支付效率等是消费者体验到关键。在商家方面，无人货架目前的维护是一个难点，如何设计一套更好的管理系统和方式来维护量大、分散的货架同样是体验和服务设计的新领域。

下面换个角度从另外一面观察，面对形式多样眼花缭乱的新技术，新体验解决方案，如何更好、更合理有创造性的运用它们，绝不是简单任意的将他们叠加起来。

前两年顺丰的“嘿客”的案例，剥开商业战略，企业管理。我们从消费者体验角度去观察分析，“嘿客”店对于周边的居民可能仅仅是一种新奇的玩意儿，想通过“快递收发站+社区便利店+线下体验店”的三位一体的模式放大用户价值但是在用户体验细节上他忽略了在“快递收发”方面现在大多消费者对非即时性大件商品倾向送货入户，现在却送到小区外门店，反而成了给用户添麻烦。而社区店面作为收发站成本非常不合算； 作为“社区便利店”，没有理解便利店需满足的是人们对商品“即时”性需求这个核心，店里没有实物商品和服务员，只提供图片，和网购屏幕，甚至还引入了3D试衣。用户下了单还是只能回家等候，用户为什么不直接在家上淘宝？而作为“线下体验店”由于无人模式缺乏主动吸引客户进入门店的方式和手段，难以转化居民等消费群体的观念。

而回顾上面星巴克烘焙工坊的案例，商家在场内引入新科技，搭建各种信息视效体验的同时，没有放弃人对人的亲切服务传统，很好的把酷炫新科技的新颖感官体验与人文关怀，周到服务结合在了一起。

再举个例子，我们看到的一些网购平台你买啥品类东西最多，平台就收品牌方的钱，大量推送这个品类的商品给你，这样的所谓消费者偏好数据智能推荐，并不是一个好的用户体验。消费者可以不再关注或把营销提醒关闭，这是一个滥用数据的方式。而可能有更好的方式是，如果平台获取了某消费者是某类型产品的常买客户，平台是否可以给这个消费者这类商品别人都没有的特别优惠价格信息和周边关联商品的推荐，既能引起用户的关注，情感体验上可能也会更友好。

从精彩纷呈的新零售商业案例中切回到用户体验视角，分析在零售业中消费者端人们对商品的几类需求及对进行消费行为时的情态，这里将其总结为“3需1感” 3需是指消费者的3方面需求：

- 对商品 抽象信息获知需求（特点、性能、品牌、价格、数据） 是什么？
- 对商品五感的感知需求（视觉、味觉、触觉、听觉、嗅觉） 感觉怎样？
- 对商品获取方式、时间了解的需求（门店、快递、多久、成本） ** 如何得到？

而1感是消费者“情感”，是消费着在购买商品与享受商家服务中互动过程所产生的情感、情绪。而这1感是完全贯穿上述3个需求的。

对于需求1具有电商基因的平台具有独特优势，因此以上如小米、盒马鲜生、亚马逊等案例中，各自能以通过线上渠道，跨空间不限时的以丰富的数字化展现形式与运营手段向目标人群投送商品信息。而他们的线下的实体店则能够满足消费者的需求2，通过线下实体店消费者可以真实的感受到商品本身。在需求3上面他们则可以结合二者能力为消费者提供最大的自由度（线下体验，线上付款/线上下单线下提货）；

在需求2方面，以上的EATALY餐厅、星巴克烘焙工坊、Warby Parker眼镜店、Sonia Rykiel时装各自通过实体门店，可接触、感受的商品/场景/服务，为消费者传递关于商品、品牌以及消费理念等主张，对如何满足消费者第二种需求进行了全新演绎。而其中的场景氛围营造，新技术手段为消费者带来新感官体验目的是为对消费者情感产生影响。

在需求3方面，以上的Easta、缤果盒子、F5未来商店、EATBOX等案例，商家通过新的技术解决方案提升自身经营效率和降低经营成本的同时，简化、便利了消费者购物流程。 而植入式无人货架则是最大限度的消除了消费者获取商品的距离与时间成本。

通过上述各类新零售业态和新零售物种的观察分析，可以有这样一个结论，完整和真正意义上的未来新零售商家或业态的内核基因是 “消费者数据智能”加上“新体验服务与理念”

“消费者数据智能”，将会迅速由传统的电商巨头们接入，成为将来新零售的核心基因之一。新零售行业的基础设施、产品、技术和数据应用会始终围绕用户体验演变，智慧化、个性化的细分需求或能被更好满足。

可以设想“消费者数据智能”在人们生活、消费的各个场景带来巨大的改变，我们拿着手机或带上AR眼镜进入商业街区或Shopping mall，通过你的线上、线下ID消费行为记录和偏好在你移动的路线上，能与你产生数据关联的商品或服务的店铺会识别你的ID，自动向你的设备发送最匹配你当下需要的资讯信息。你可以选择最感兴趣的信息去到店内实际体验，如果满意立即在移动设备上下单快递到家，在你吃好玩好回家的时候，你刚刚下单的商品也一同到家了。

有人总结新零售的一个公式，借用了爱因斯坦的质能方程：E=MC2，公式中的E是Earn盈利，M是商品Merchandise，而C就是Customer，C2是顾客的平方。顾客的平方可以理解为建立在商品本身属性上的“新体验服务和理念”，商家只有通过独具匠心的、有故事的商品和体验服务、才能能够激发消费者热情甚至内心共鸣，才有可能建立平方效应。

围绕商业活动里人、货、场中所有商业元素的重构是新零售的重要的标志，通过以上新零售案例的总结梳理与观察分析，勾勒和呈现出新零售中消费者需求、情感（人）互动、商品信息个性化定制化的呈现、商品感官体验（货）、商家业态、能力与行为（场），三要素互动、影响关系的视图，与可能的各种接触点、事件发生点。试图通过这个框架发现新零售的环境下的用户体验设计可能拓展的范围和切入点。

新零售在2017年开启了新商业时代，序幕刚拉开，精彩还在前方。平台、商家期待在这个巨大新机遇面前大展拳脚，消费者期待看到一个全新、绚丽多彩的未来生活、消费场景。我们可以持续观察和见证这一变革，用户体验服务设计可以作为一个中介性力量，牵手二者的美好愿景。

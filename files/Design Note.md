# Get Professional. Useful Habits for UX Designers.

To become a UX expert, designers need to work hard on the daily basis. Constant self-improvement and love to what you do are two key factors helping to become a master of your craft. Of course, all UX experts have their personal secrets of the success still they have something in common. There are certain characteristics which differ amateurs from the real professionals. The new article describes habits which expert UX designers possess.

## They listen to users

The success of a product is defined by several points including the level of satisfaction which it brings to the users. To make a website or an application meet users needs, you have to know what exactly users require. So, before creating UX for digital product, the professionals always go user researching.

The process of user research applies collecting and analyzing the information received from the potential users. The obtained outcome helps designers go deeper into details of the target audience as well as comprehend their preferences and psychological peculiarities. Applying user research UX experts actually can step into the user' shoes and find the effective solutions for a user friendly product. UX design built on empathy has the great chances to meet users needs and draw attention to a product.

## They conduct usability testing

Usability is one of the key factors influencing the  quality of a digital product. so, to see if a website or an app is usable and to distinguish possible problems in UX, designers need to apply the technique of usability testing.

The level of usability is defined by five aspect: learnability, satisfaction, efficiency, memorability, and errors. learnability stands for how easy users can attain tasks during the first usage and satisfaction is if the usage process feels pleasant. efficiency is determined by users' ability to accomplish a task quickly while memorability depends on time which people need to re-establish their proficiency after a period of not using a product. and finally, designers track the number of errors users make and how easily they can learn from these mistake.

Usability testing is usually conducted at the UX building stage before a project goes to the development team. it allows changing inefficient solution easier than in a complete product. moreover, usability testing allows watching the users' reactions while a product is used and estimate how much they like it or don't. this technique is helpful for gathering the essential information for the effective user-centered design.

## They pay attention to the information architecture 

in one of our previous articles, we defined the information architecture as a science which strives at organizing and structuring content so that users would easily adjust to the functionality of the product and could find everything they need without big effort.

many UX experts learn the IA principles since they believe the information architecture is a foundation of the effective design. if the content is badly organized, users May have difficulties with navigation, so they can get lost and feel annoyed. that's why even compelling content elements and powerfully UI design can fail without appropriate IA.

some May think that it's impractical to devote much time to IA building and the effective information architecture is crucial for powerful user experience design. it helps users quickly navigate through content and find everything they need without striking a blow.

## They  strive for clarity 

a quality digital product has to give a quick access to the features which users come for. the main objective for designers is to help people easily reach the desired functionality and make the process of usage pleasant and clear.

while planning problem solving UX, professionals should work out which of design elements will be helpful and which of them will distract users. unneeded functionality makes a product complicated and has the bad influence on the user experience. what's more, it's important to keep mental models which include common UI patterns for specific types of products. the thing is that design is often built on the elements which are already familiar to users. such an approach make navigation much more intuitive and simple.

## They consider real life context 

Being an idealist is not always a good thing, especially for UX masters. it may happen that some designers just forget to consider all the life factors which have the significant impact on UX.

a product is often built and tested in comfortable conditions, but people do not always have a chance to use apps in such pleasant environment. the modern world is too rash and people often have lots of tasks to do per minute. however, despite all the circumstances websites and mobile applications need to be enjoyable. designers have to consider possible disturbance and create UX that way so people could manage everything even without being 100% engaged with a product, especially a mobile application.

## They are open to new tools

Being a profound user of Photo-shop or sketch is a great advantage for a professional still it's always a good idea to try new tools. it may seem as time waste for some designers so they don't see a point in it. however, you May be surprised how advanced the new technology can be and what functionality it provides. learning new tools you are not obliged to apply them as the major instruments but you can use them as additional helpers which will be useful in certain situations.

## They never stop learning

 UX design is a field which never stays still. each day brings new ideas and opportunities which designers willingly share around the world. today there are so many techniques and methods which UX experts apply for creating quality products and it May be hard to keep up with all of them. nevertheless, for a UX professional, it's vital to learn as much as they can because this kind of knowledge only improves the professional skills.

in addition, designers should  not concentrate only on the design aspects. learning the wide spectrum of sciences which somehow relate to the design can be extremely helpful in the creative workflow. for example, it is recommended to learn psychology which helps to understand users and their needs as well as learn some basics of programming so that you could have the better vision of product development.

## They stay up to date

Digital technologies evolve pretty fast and UX experts have to follow the updates. it would be difficult to create the proper design without knowing the peculiarities of the devices it's meant for. moreover, the trends in design field are also changing quickly so UX designers need to know what's on the top now and which solutions step aside.

## They don't forget to get inspired

 some people may think that UX design is a complex science with the strict rules which doesn't have a room for creativity. however, it's a FALSE thought since UX masters never forget to let the imagination out of control. many original and unique solutions are born due to designers' open-mindedness and inspiration. that's why designers always have to charge their creative power with the help of their favorite activities.

## To sum up

let's remember Sean covey's words:"we become what we repeatedly do."work hard , improve yourself and you will be able to become a master in your field. 

stay tuned!!!

# Keep Fit. UI Design for Fitness apps

a professional athlete billie jean king once said:"sports teaches you character, it teaches you to play by the rules, it teaches you to know what it feels like to win and lose.--- it teaches you about life." sports has become a part of your routine a long time ago. even more, today a healthy lifestyle is a top trend which constantly grows its popularity across the world.

fitness apps are the key helpers for people who strive to get fit. their functionality gives a lot of opportunities and makes keeping fit easier. understanding the significant impact of these applications on users' everyday life, designers do their best to activate the problem-solving potential of fitness apps. today's article describes common screens and essential UI elements for fitness apps.

## sign-in and profile screen

fitness app is something like a pocket instructor telling you what to do and gives a feedback on your achievements. to make it more comfortable and personalized, designers need to create an effective profile UI.

before users obtain their profiles they usually go through the sign-in process. fitness apps, as well as the other ones, can allow logging in via social networks still there are some aspects which users have to fill in to create a personalized profile. the applications usually require the personal data including age, gender, weight, and height which helps to define users' physical condition. profile creation is often similar to filling in an app;ication form. this way users can easily provide the needed information to make a profile more personalized.

the major objective of a fitness app is to help users in their self-improvement, the reason why profiles should contain not only the personal data but also the user's achievements such as the number of burnt calories or personal records in sports. it's important to not to overload the profile screen with the unnecessary information otherwise user interface may look chaotic.

## home screen

it's a core element for any type of apps. home screens serve as the main point where users start the journey within a product. creating UI for home screen designers need to think of it as a center of navigation and make sure users will be able to operate it easily.

first of all, home screen should provide access to the other parts of the app. designers can choose various ways of the presentation from a sidebar with minimalistic icons to the click-able sub-headers leading to the different sections of app content. the choice often depends on the number of features provided by the product as well as the platform which it is meat for.

## activity screen

people who aim at getting fit always have to do various physical activities. fitness apps provide users with the feature which helps to track how active they are during a day. to make a sufficient UI for activity screen, designers include different kinds of activities and sports. traditionally, fitness apps provide tracking time spent on sports as well as measuring the distance which users cover during a day. the distance can be calculated in two ways: walking is measured by the number of steps and running is usually measured in miles(kilometers).

the information about users' activity is often presented via diagrams of various forms. such presentation contributes the effective visual perception of the data which includes many numerals. also, designers often apply custom icons representing each kind of activity. this way the screen looks clean and neat even if users have a really active life.

## heart rate screen

the heart is an engine which lets our body live and function, so it's important to follow its condition daily. many fitness apps can be connected to the various devices such as fitness wearables which allow measuring pulse. the applications usually transfer the data gathered with devices on a heart rate screen.

user interface representing the feature should be simple with the minimum of elements so that it could be easily operated. since the process of pulse measuring takes some time it may be a good idea to supply the UI with sufficient animation which will show the loading process. for example, motion designers can animate an illustration of the heart showing it beats. custom illustrations along with motion design can make UI look more proficient and make the process of the pulse measuring more interactive.

## sleep tracking screen

nice sleep is a guarantee of the human health. sports people know it better than anyone else and always try to control the time and quality of their sleep. fitness apps show the gathered information during a night which includes the time and stages of sleep. there are four stages of sleep: the first and the second are called light sleep, the third is deep sleep and the fourth is rem sleep. the applications track these stages and in the morning users can see the statistics. the data on sleep is often shown as graphs.

## calories screen

they say that fitness people are obsessed with calories. well, there is truth in the words because if you want to get fit it's vital to control what and how much you eat. as we said above, fitness applications show the information on the number of burnt calories based on the activity results. the calories data can be displayed on the activity screen as well as on the personal profile. however, it may be an effective solution to create a separate screen to provide users with the expanded information on the lost calories.

## progress screen

to stay motivated and continue self-improvement, it's important to know that the hard work gives results. the progress screen shows the statistics about users achievements along with failures. here the graphs will be the best choice. if people have the progress, they see that their results are getting better and the scales on the graphs go higher.

## schedule screen

there can be many sports activities in different time and different places so the schedule seems to be essential in this situation. the screen of schedule is standardized, but to make it unique and original, designers can add some interesting icons representing various sports directions.

## goals screen

goals move us to achieve more and more, especially if we talk about fitness. people stat doing sport because they have some goals like losing wight or shaping up. in fitness applications, users set maybe a bit less radical goals but easier to achieve on a regular basis. they often include walking a certain number of steps per day or week along with burning the fixed amount of calories.

the screen of goals can be presented as a sheet divided into categories: to do, doing, done. this way users will see how much they have managed to achieve and what they need to strive for. in addition, designers can settle the system of awards which will help users be even more motivated. we've already described awards as effective gamification tools which contribute increasing user engagement. you can find detailed info in our previous articles.

the sport requires persistence and fortitude and so does the creation of sufficient UI design. learn the basics, add some inspiration and you can surprise yourself. 

stay tuned!!!

# case study: lunnscape. identity design for a landscape company 

the task of logo and identity development seems to be not really simple today. more and more companies and products are filling the market with branding designs of various complexity and quality. what ever is the business or charity, it needs the original and recognizable image to support brand awareness and promotion. on the other hand, is that so easy to get original stepping into the ocean of various and diverse competition? this is the time for designers to come into play.

today we offer you another case study showing the way which a brand passes to get its face designed in one of the recent projects, tubik team had a task of creating a logo for a landscaping business with further stretching the style and visual presentation on a number of items promoting the corporate identity. this challenge was assigned to graphic designer denys boldyriev.

# project

redesign of corporate identity for landscape firm lunnscape.

# process

Lunnscape is a company based in Florida, USA, and specializing in landscaping services to commercial properties like office and courtyard spaces, parks etc. the firm was founded by steven lunn in 2009: it's easy to see that the brand name presents the harmonic combination of the founder's name with the key word 《landscape》. being already established and known on the local market, the company strived for refreshing the visual identity and putting its promotion to the next level. the client came to us with a very basic branding they already used and wanted a new design corresponding to the modern trends and requirements and enhancing the connection with the customers.

we had already had a chance to create a brand identity for a landscape firm  - it was shared here in the case studies on logo design and corporate branding for andre. that made the challenge even more interesting, as the companies providing similar services had different approaches and vision of their brand images and needed new original looks. there is always the place for creative perspective in design, which makes the job so cool.

for this project, we accomplished a set of tasks according to the client's marketing strategy:

1. landscape company logo
2. slogan
3. theme illustrations
4. corporate letterhead, envelop, and business cards
5. stationery
6. corporate vehicle
7. style guile

# logo

brainstorming ideas on the task to design a logo for a landscaping business, most people will imagine something connected with plants, flowers or their elements. that's a natural and very quick association. actually, that approach had also been followed in the previous version of the logo presented with a simple stroke image featuring a leaf. however, keen on getting fresh stuff which would distinguish the company from the competitors, the client stated the wish to step aside from the traditional associations and try other creative directions. they wanted the brand sign to be dynamic, immediately connected to the theme of nature but moving away from ideas and patterns typical for landscaping logo design.

as well as in the previous case study on identity for reborn restaurant, early ideas were visualized in in the quick pencil sketches to catch the the possible silhouette of the future logo and discuss possible directions of creative search with the stakeholders. after that, the set of basic digitized options were offered. to make the picture full and ensure how far the logo should move from the common associations set, the designer provided the variety of options, as you can see below. some of the options were visually connected to the plants and greenery, for example, the letter mark made of leaves, the image of a flower, the shapes of landscape site patches also resembling the flower petals. also, there were shown the shapes of trees presented in balanced geometric forms giving the room for flexibility in a landscape logo design. the other options in this set were focused on dynamic images of living creatures like insects or birds.

so, it's easy to see that in general, the creative search moved around two global themes, flora and fauna, both effective to set the instant connection to the theme of nature and land care. thinking about the number of factors, the client put their preference on the image of a dragonfly as a mascot. here's the next stage of the logo design process - construction of a symbol image.

for the variety of usage options, the mascot image was added with the word mark featuring the company name and accomplished in a style harmonically corresponding to the mascot. so, the final lunnscape logo is designed as a mascot of a dragonfly in an aqua circle depicting one of the fauna symbols which habitats in Florida nature. the dragonfly visualizes a bright creature on a green lawn, besides, its wings look like flower leaves. turquoise circle with a dragon fly gives a solid stamp effect as well as looks playful due to the color palette. the word mark typography complements and also unveils the core brand services of the company.

both the brand mark and word-mark go hand in hand to keep an ultimate balance for user's perception and brand recognition. having agreed and polished all the details in the landscape logo design, the creative team moved to the work on slogan and corporate identity development.

# slogan

the next step of the creative process was to support design with copy-writing: the company needed a new slogan, so the copywriter was also engaged in the project. short and catchy, the slogan had to support the idea of the beauty made by people but rooting in natural harmony. what's more, the slogan had to set the tight link with the logo, so that in combination they effectively supported each other.

the company name uses the altered version replacing the keyword "land" with "lunn", but still preserves the general structure of the word so that the word "landscape" could be easily restored in mind. among several directions for the slogan, we developed the one which used the word "land" acturalizing its double meaning: land as an object of services the company provides and land as the action of coming down through the air and rest on the ground or another surface. this approach enabled to set the link with the logo featuring the dragonfly so that together they presented the clear message.

after discussing the several sets of variants, the final version of the slogan was agreed upon "landed on nature beauty".

# branded items

stationery and business cards

the designer prepared a set of templates for company documents, including business cards, letterhead, and envelopes, that reflect the brand identity in an elegant, non-distracting way. it enabled to stretch the design solutions of logo design for the landscape company and give them flexible ways of usage for different business purposes. as you can see below, business cards and the title page of a letter blank used the stroke version of the logo appplied to the combination of corporate colors.

# 7 tips to enhance mobile interactions

the quality of mobile design can be measured simply. when the process of usage is so smooth and effortless that people don't even think about it, it is the sign of the professional design work. on the other hand, if there are some problems in the inter action system, users will definitely notice them and won't be pleased about it.

mobile apps are expected to be clear and easy to operate so that they could be effectively used anytime and anyplace. designers' task is to create an intuitive interface which will guide users within the app helping them operate its functionality without problems. in this article, we describe the essential aspects of the effective mobile interaction system along with the tips helping designers to create intuitive design.

## increase learnability

every designer strives at creating a unique product with original interactions and navigation systems. such an approach allows standing out a crowd and being noticeable on the market. however, creating absolutely new environment designers have to think how users will adjust to it.

if the interaction system of a mobile application has no logic and sequence or it doesn't respond to needs of the target audience, it may be frustrating and annoying. that condition is critical for ux, so people will simply give up on trying to decipher an app and quit it.

to avoid this kind of outcome, designers need to care about learn-ability of the interactive elements. learn-ability stands for how easy tasks can be attained during the learn-ability, designers need to keep it simple and clear helping quickly adjust to it. also, the system should be consistent and logical so that users could identify the repeating patterns and use a mobile app intuitively.

## consider multiple holds

we all are different in many ways, even how we hold smart-phones. the way of holding smart-phones depends on various factors including the situation and conditions in which the app is used as well as the task we need to accomplish.

there are three common types of holding a mobile. the first is when we take it with one hand and navigate it with a thumb. another way is to hold a smart-phone in one hand and interact with it with the forefinger of the other hand. also, the type which is common for chatting people is holding a phone in two hands using both thumbs for actions. of course, there are other types of holds but these three are thought to be the most common.

considering this fact, designers have to figure out if the layout elements placed effectively for different holds. one handed hold requires special attention since it has the most limited space of reach. to make the interaction process within a mobile app effortless it may be a good idea to put the key components at the bottom of the screen so that users would be able to reach tap areas easily. in addition, the interactive elements should be big engough so there would be no chance for a mis-tap.

## apply recognition patterns

when a new app can be used intuitively it means that the designer did a good job. to provide intuitive interactions, UI design has to contain recognition patterns. they are the elements which users are already familiar with and those which give slight hints on how a app works. the thing is that using an application we are expecting to see certain things associated with the definite kind of product. for example, working with e-commerce apps we are used to seeing cart icons along with CTA buttons "buy". familiar elements in a new app make people feel more confident in their actions.

users become accustomed to things quickly and their absence makes them feel uncomfortable. that's why, if you plan to use custom interactive elements, don't forget to add some standard components. this way a new application won't overwhelm with an absolutely unfamiliar environment and will help to learn quickly.

## make a clean UI

a big pitfall of mobile UI design is small screens of the devices. designers have to figure out how to cnclude all content in a short space without turning user interface into clutter. clean UI design helps effectively interact with a product since all the core elements can be easily reached.

to create neat mobile UI it is recommended to use icons as interactive components. copy elements often can be too big for the small screen, so icons are a sufficient alternative. they can explain a function visualizing it with simple shapes and it helps to save the space on the screen. however, during usability testing, it should be thoroughly checked if the icons are perceived appropriately and transfer the right message.

## decrease the number of actions

probably, many of us have the experience of using an annoying mobile app which made us take a long way before we could finally accomplish the task. it may often be caused by ineffective interaction system which employs too many actions and the unnecessary functionality.

mobile apps usually serve as problem-solving assistants, so it's vital for them to be designed ergonomically. it means that designers have to apply only core functional elements which will get the users right to the point they needed. minimum of actions won't make your product look primitive. it will help a mobile app be effective and pleasing in usage. remember that people mostly rate the quality of an application not by extraordinary features but how helpful it is.

## add game mechanics

based on the facts described above, we can say that an effective mobile interaction system should be simple and clear to use so that it could be operated without problems.

however, simplifying the interface it's vital not make it boring. apps which seem ordinary have fewer chances to gain users' attention. that's why it's important to bring some emotional aspects into applications that look standard at the first glance.

to make the process interesting and catchy, it may be a good idea to use gamification. it is the technique of exerting game mechanics into the non-game environment like mobile applications. various challenges and leader-boards along with the awards and stickers motivate users to interact with a product more and come back to it constantly.

what's more, implementing a game mechanic called a user journey is an effective way to create clear layout and transitions. a journey is user's progression stages at the time of usage. designers create UX that way so that people could go step-by-step through the various features which gradually change depending on needs of the target audience. an approach helps to avoid problems with incomprehensible interactions and functions.

last but not least, gamification adds the elements of fun. users enjoy entertainments, challenges, and competitive spirit similar to video games, so they are encouraged to go back. people always need some kind of recreational activity so that they could escape from everyday routine for a bit. by adding the fun element into a casual application, you help to reduce some stress and relax for a moment.

## don't forget about testing

mobile interaction design aims at creating a user-friendly product which will be pleasure to use under different circumstances. but how can a designer define if an app is usable enough and distinguish possible problems in UX? this is when usability testing comes into play.

usability testing is an essential stage in creating mobile apps helping to evaluate it by testing on the potential audience. it is usually conducted at the UX building stage before a project goes to the development team so that inefficient solutions could be changed easier and faster.

various usability testing methods allow identifying problems and bugs and quickly eliminate them. this way designers can improve all the aspects of UX ensuring user satisfaction.

so, before you deliver a project to the development team remember to handle testing. test it by yourself, on your colleagues, on the potential users and then you'll get the desired outcome.

a simple mobile interaction system is not that easy to create. it requires hard word, concentration and lots of practice before you receive sufficient results. 

stay tuned!

# feel homey. handy tips for home page design

there's no place like home, they say. and in the growing world of websites for all the needs and aims, it actually works the same. home page has multiple functions: it's a card of invitation, a starting point of the journey around the website, a storage of the vital links and data, and a strategic asset for marketing goals. in the majority of cases, it is often the first visual and emotional touch to the website. no doubt, design is one of the core ways to make this touch gentle, smart and helpful. today we are discussing some effective tips for creating user-friendly home pages.

one of our previous articles has already given the insights into the definition, types of content such a page usually includes and basic design strategies in creasing home page usability. continuing the topic, today we are adding more recommendations organized around three essential aspects: information, interaction, and appearance.

## information

to use or not to use? that is the question. in the vast majority of cases, home page is the point of user's decision. in the early 2000s guru of usability Jacob Nielsen mentioned in his article: your home page is often your first - and possibly your last - chance to attract and retain each customer, rather like the front page of a newspaper. with all the progress the world wide web has witnessed, this position doesn't change: home page often defines if a user goes further around the website. and it is done not only by beauty and style but first of all by information which is looked for by visitors to the resource. making it accessible, noticeable and clear, designers grow the chances of positive user experience.

 in general, home page can include the following data:

1. the nature of the website: the page has to instantly inform users if it's a company website, blog, e-commerce website, social network, educational platform or anything else;
2. brand or company identity elements: home page requires a recognizable visual presentation distinguishing the website from its competitors. if there is  a product, company or  brand behind it, web-page design should be seen as a brand and apply strategies of identity design for better brand awareness.
3. benefits of the website: it should quickly inform users why the website can be helpful or interesting for them.
4. internal search: many users come to the websites with clear goals, so functionality to search right from the homepage will make interaction highly productive.
5. links to the core interaction zones
6. contact data and links to social networks
7. signs of trust: testimonials, reviews, big numbers of presence in social networks



the solution which of the mentioned points are going to be included and how they are going to be spread on the layout should depend on the goals of the website and the research of target audience. let's check some tips effective in this aspect.

## fill the header with core data

as we mentioned in the article about web header design, it is the top part of the web-page, which people see before scrolling the page in the first seconds of introduction to the website. headers can include a variety of meaningful layout elements, for example:

1. basic elements of brand identity: log, slogan etc.
2. tag-line setting the theme of the website
3. links to the core categories of website content
4. links to the most important social networks
5. basic contact information
6. a language switch in case of multilingual interface
7. search field
8. subscription field
9. links to interaction with the product such as trial version, downloading from the App-Store etc.


obviously, it's impossible to put all the list into one header. moreover, its not a good idea to put everything because the header overloaded with diverse information will distract users' attention. as Arron Walter said in his book, if everything yells for your viewer's attention, nothing is heard. that is why the choice which information goes to the header and what is looks like arises on the solid ground of communication between a designer, a stakeholder and a marketing specialist. header is the top zone of early interaction: eye-tracking studies show that the web page is mostly scanned starting from it. so decide, which elements are primary to achieve website goals and use the limited space of header for them. for example, on a news website or a big e-commerce platform search field is crucial for positive UX while on a small company website it may be not needed at all.

 ## apply informative tag line

don't think the users are going to wander around the website trying to set why it's useful for them. being surrounded by the thousands of website, they may get away at the first seconds if they don't see a clear reason to stay. so, give it to them - it's the time for a tag line. in marketing terms, it is the name of a short and catchy phrase that summarizes the benefits or gives the description of the website. including the keywords setting the proper theme and taking the place on the first level of visual hierarchy for the page, the tag line will quickly inform users why the website is worth their attention.

## enable users to contact with duty holders

home page is usually the place where people expect to find the contact info any time they need it. the most popular placement for it is footer, the bottom part of the page. however, if any kind of contact data is core for conversion, it's logical to put in the pre-scroll area or even a header. for example, if the website presents the delivery service or on-line shop, users may want to call more frequently and this ability will have a direct impact on conversion rate. meanwhile, for an entertainment or news resource, it may be not that crucial so it's placed in zones of less active interaction. however, in any case, the contact data should be available from home. among other reasons, it is one of the factors influencing the level of trust to the website.

contacts can be presented in various formats. they can reveal the data such as phone number and location, emails, links to messengers, contact forms and instant chat window. making the phone numbers clickable is supportive as many users now browse from their smart phones and may want to call right from there. the address can be also clickable opening the screenshot or map showing how to find the location. the solutions have to be based on thoughtful user research setting target audience's expectations, level of tech literacy and the most convenient ways of contact for them. for instance, if your target audience is teenagers, just giving the phone number may be not effective as they really stick to messengers and social networks. at the same time, if your users are elderly people, social networks may not work in comparison to a phone number.

## make call to action element instantly visible

unlike the landing pages, focused on narrow and concise goals, home page contents are quite diverse. that's why it's important for a ux designer to care how users will see what they really need to see in all that mass of data. no doubt, it cannot happen that all, let's say, fifty available links on the home page are equally important. so, to make the page usable, all the interactive elements in the layout should be prioritized. visually, it can be done via the rules of visual hierarchy so taht users could see the key things first. and among them, call to action elements should be noticed instantly. otherwise, there will be loss in conversion not because users didn't want to do the action but because they did't find how to do it.

## interaction

the next aspect to consider is interaction - hte way how users perceive, process and interact with the information they find on the home page as well as the website in general. the next set of tips is all about that.

check scannability and mind eye-tracking models

it's not a secret that users first scan pages and only then make a decision if they want o get dip into details. interface designers are highly recommended to study eye-tracking models which are now described in numerous publications, with the most prominent contribution by Nielsen Norman Blog sharing the results of actual experiments in that sphere for a couple of decades. in brief, researchers mention three typical models of scanning: Gutenberg Diagram, Z-Pattern, And F-Pattern. in case you want to get more, we have given detailed descriptions in an earlier article, so now let's just check them on schemes.

scannability of web pages i enhanced with visual hierarchy that enables designers to show the content in terms of its priority and navigates user from the core zones to the secondary ones. scannability is one of the parameters to be carefully tested all the time as it has a great impact on usability of the page and its problem-solving potential.

## remember that patterns are user's friends

every creative person feels the urge to apply the original and unique solutions and think out of the box all the time. however, make not to go too far on that way. remember that the website is made not for creative contests or gallery of fame but for real users. as we mentioned in the post about social networks design, the power of habit in terms of user experience can be stronger than the wish of revolution. surely, the dose of wow-effect is needed, but not so much to knock down the user. on home page, too much of design revolution might confuse and scare: if the first page is so hard to understand, user thinks, what's going to be next? study the habits of interaction and typical products for that particular target audience to make their habits their power. strive for the balance between innovation and traditions.

## make the search field easily accessible

as we said above, search means much, especially for the users coming to the resource with a clear understanding what they want. A/B testing can support the analysis of its most productive placement on the page layout. it can be a small search field, an icon in the header, a long horizontal field across the page as we have here in Tubik Blog. the main thing is to make it noticeable and clear so that users didn't waste their time.

## use different menus and interaction zones

as home pages can provide a variety of links, tabs, fields and buttons, they should be grouped in different menus and zones instead of being given as the list of links. for example, double menu in the header can present two layers of navigation. we have shown the example of such a trick in the case study for a bakery website design. the website uses a sticky header which has two levels of navigation. the upper menu shows the links to social networks, the logo, search, shopping cart and hamburger button hiding the extended menu. the second line of navigation gives instant connection to the core interaction areas: products catalog, locations for the point of sales, news and special offers, information about the service and contact section. visual and typographic hierarchy makes all the elements clear and easily scanned providing solid ground for quick interaction right from home page.

## make the home page accessible from any point of the website

home is usually the foundation of the website structure. so, users need to have a chance to get back home from any page they are on. check it when all the pages are designed not to miss this abvious still vital interaction.

## don't direct all the outer traffic to home page

for simple one page websites this question is not actual: indeed, they represent only a home page which satisfies one or multiple functions and there is no other place where the traffic could be directed from the outer sources. the same happens if the website is not complex, home is not overloaded with diverse links and navigation elements, so conversion can be reached right from it while other pages play secondary roles. in this case directing all the traffic to the most informative part of the site, which also enables a user to accomplish necessary action and get what they need, is a good idea.

however, for complex websites and platforms, especially if they satisfy multiple needs of broad target audience, this approach can be the step killing profitability and reducing conversion rates. the user can get scared, distracted or even annoyed with the amount of information they have to get through to find what they need, especially if focused on a particular narrow goal. using landing pages in the case when you need to concentrate user's attention on something specific can be the efficient way of solving this problem. landing page is focused on one item, to make it quickly found and reduce delays when target user seeks for specific operations, services or items. this is the issue of especially high importance in the case of e-commerce websites when unwise design solutions bring to poor user experience and financial losses.

## appearance

the third set of tips is concentrated on the page looks. no doubt, the recommendations are applicable for any kind of webpage, still, on home page, they ten to be more influential.

## be stringent in color choice

color is power which can either strengthen or ruin other design decisions. choosing the color palette, remember that colors influence user perception. studying color psychology is helpful to make choices that transfer the right message. attention to traditional color theory will help to find the color combinations that will look elegant and harmonic. one more popular issue is choosing between light or dark background: the solution is mostly based on the type of content website presents. text- based websites usually use light and airy interfaces while visual based ones can apply dark background to make the images look deeper and more stylish.

## apply recognizable visual prompts and associations

being full of data, home pages usually include the variety of icons and illustrations. choosing them, always test their recognizability and check if they build right associations. if there is the risk of double meaning or culture differences of target audience, supporting the icons or illustrations with a short copy might be helpful.

# 11 profitable strategies for e-commerce UI design

 ratings of e-commerce are booming and rocketing. people are getting more and more confident in buying things on-line. the report by big commerce on customers buying habits in 2016-2017 shows really interesting stats about on-line shopping:

1. 51% of Americans prefer to shop on-line
2. 96% of Americans with Internet access have made an on-line purchase in their life, 80% in the past month alone
3. E-commerce is growing 23% year-over-year, yet 46% of American small businesses do not have a website
4. on-line orders increase 8.9% in Q3 2016, but average order value(AOV) increased only 0.2% - indicating that transactional growth is outpacing total revenue



the numbers above still haven't stopped their increasing. that wouldn't be reasonable for any business to ignore such global trends having a great impact on profits and reaching customers. for the last couple of years here in tubik we see the obvious and logical growth of interest from big and small businesses in establishing their presence on-line via websites and mobile applications. based on our experience and the research of the sphere today we offer you the article telling a bit more about strategies and best practices in UI design for e-commerce.

so, let's start with the 11 points which are important to consider when you are designing e-commerce user interfaces.

## 1. make the branding instantly visible

from the business perspective, branding is a crucial thing: it enables to provide a product, company or service with a recognizable face and personality. in general terms, branding means a sort of image created via a set of distinguishing features and promoting awareness and recognizability of the product or service on the market.

branding tends to be essential in an e-commerce user interface design, especially if stakeholders want to use the digital product as the additional flow of customer attraction. moreover, identity integrated thoughtfully into the interface is the effective way to increase brand awareness. the time taken for proper market and user research, target audience definition, competition analysis and development of brand identity on the basis of all that data by a professional designer is a worthy investment. if that's done before launching the process of UI design, the product gets higher chances of becoming recognizable faster and easier.

in this case, UI designer working on the interface, its color palette, shapes, types and fonts, illustrations and icons, will consider design solutions appropriate and corresponding to the general branding concept of the product that will make them mutually supporting each other. it provides more natural and harmonic feeling of the brand in general and the particular interface as an integral part of this brand.

there are numerous ways to add branding to the interface, still some layout zones and elements which have the highest potential in this issue:

headers. in the article about website header design, we showed in detail that headers present the area of high visibility. so putting strategically important elements of branding in it is a good way to strengthen its memorability.

splash screens. in mobile applications, splash screen or welcome screen is the first screen seen by a user while the application is loading and starting. it's good idea to use a logo, mascot or any other thing setting the instant visual connection with a brand. moreover, adding a bit of wow-effect with slight stylish animation, it's easy to make the sign even more attractive and memorable.

pre-loaders and pull-to-refresh indicators. these are the elements which show the flow of the current loading process on the app or website. branding applied elegantly in them can add much into the consistency of both UI and identity design.

mascots. mascots are images, usually personified, which often represent the brand, product or service identity and can be its symbolic convention in all the application or website. mascots push the limits of personification and give the chance to create the unexpected combinations of elements or make fantastic and non-existing characters alive. a mascot becomes the element of identity and inter-connector between the user and the product. in many cases, it is the basic element of communication and interaction delivering the necessary message to the user.

## 2. set clear and easy navigation as the core task

in the article on UX design for e-commerce, we stated: whatever an amazing website or app is, whatever the stylish and trendy design and breathtaking images it features, its success will be measured not by the number of wows. the efficiency is analyzed simply - by he number of complete purchases. if users don't buy, design means nothing while stakeholders lose their money, clear intuitive navigation plays the premier violin here. at every step of interaction, uses need to understand clearly plenty of simple things, like:

1. what company or brand they are dealing with
2. what page they are at
3. where the menu is
4. how they can get back to home page or catalog
5. where the search and filters are
6. how long the page-loading process is going to take
7. how they can see the detailed information about the item
8. how they can choose between the option for the same item (color, size, etc)
9. how they can pay for the item
10. how they can save the items they could like to get back to later
11. how they can contact the seller
12. how they can see the rating and reviews of previous buyers etc.


## 3. check the scannability of the page or screen

as it was already mentioned, users don't usually read and observe all the content on the page or screen from the starting point: instead, they start from quick scanning to understand if it contains something they need or want. knowing the eye-tracking models, gestalt principles and laws of visual hierarchy, designers and information architects can put the core data and interaction elements to the zones of high and natural visibility.

calls to action(CTA), in particular, should be instantly seen in the first seconds on the page or screen. in the interfaces for e-commerce, CTA elements are the core factor of effective interaction with the product playing the crucial role in usability and navigability and therefore in getting profits. when all the path of interaction and transitions is built clearly for users but CTA elements is not thought-out, placed or designed well, users can get confused and will need to take additional effort trying to achieve their goals. that increases the risk of poor conversion rate and general user experience.

## 4. minimize user's efforts whenever its possible

the respect to the customer lies not in pouring out your thanks. the real respect is in saving users' time and effort day in and day out. here are some design practices which can make the inter face effort-saving.

show related products. seen on the item page as recommendations close to the features of this particular product can make the process of search and browsing much faster for users. however, it's vital to check together with developers that this section really works according to the algorithm which show s suitable items, not random ones.

strive for a minimal number of clicks. if going from page to page or jumping from screen to screen is not a part of the journey into the sales funnel, save every users' click possible. too many operations are tiring and annoying which is a kind of negative emotion. and emotions have a huge influence on user experience and make retaining users much harder. minimize the number of clicks on the way of choosing and buying whenever it's possible - his way you respect user's time better than politest word of thanks.

simplify the sign-in process. imagine the situation when you got to the amazing website selling the goods of your dream, and they presented in such a stylish way that you want to buy them at once. but when you click the button buy, you are taken to the huge long from which you have to fill in to register on that website. that will cool down your hot wish to buy everything right here, right now, isn't it ? you change from the state take my money, give me that to really? 20 points to fill in before i can buy? in split seconds. not all the users will survive that transformation and the website or app will lose a part of buyers. so, it's necessary to make the sign-in/log-in process as simple as possible.

user shape and color marking to group the items or types of content. color and shape codes enable designers to apply gestalt principle of similarity not only on one screen or page but on the whole app or website. color or shape markers simplify navigation and keep the consistency of design enabling users to remember the prompts and find content they want easily. for e-commerce platforms which are usually full of numerous items, it can make the interface much more user-friendly.

check that perception of the layout is natural and harmonic for the human eye. there are numerous things that have an impact on decision-making, and harmony is one of them. eye-tensing color combinations, unreadable or not combining fonts, aggressive background, intrusive pop-ups or animations, annoying sounds or pages loading for ages- any point of that stuff can spoil the experience quickly and move users away.

## 5. don't go too far experimenting

there are many articles and videos calling creative people to hear their heart, trust their guts and think out-of-the-box. however, design is not just pure creativity striving to show all the power of original solution. first of all, it the way to solve the problem and make users happier. so, it's vital to look at the interface from user's perspective and find the way to make interactions that will provide the smooth and easy way to conversion. in the article on home page design strategies we mentioned: the website is made not for

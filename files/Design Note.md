# Get Professional. Useful Habits for UX Designers.

To become a UX expert, designers need to work hard on the daily basis. Constant self-improvement and love to what you do are two key factors helping to become a master of your craft. Of course, all UX experts have their personal secrets of the success still they have something in common. There are certain characteristics which differ amateurs from the real professionals. The new article describes habits which expert UX designers possess.

## They listen to users

The success of a product is defined by several points including the level of satisfaction which it brings to the users. To make a website or an application meet users needs, you have to know what exactly users require. So, before creating UX for digital product, the professionals always go user researching.

The process of user research applies collecting and analyzing the information received from the potential users. The obtained outcome helps designers go deeper into details of the target audience as well as comprehend their preferences and psychological peculiarities. Applying user research UX experts actually can step into the user' shoes and find the effective solutions for a user friendly product. UX design built on empathy has the great chances to meet users needs and draw attention to a product.

## They conduct usability testing

Usability is one of the key factors influencing the  quality of a digital product. so, to see if a website or an app is usable and to distinguish possible problems in UX, designers need to apply the technique of usability testing.

The level of usability is defined by five aspect: learnability, satisfaction, efficiency, memorability, and errors. learnability stands for how easy users can attain tasks during the first usage and satisfaction is if the usage process feels pleasant. efficiency is determined by users' ability to accomplish a task quickly while memorability depends on time which people need to re-establish their proficiency after a period of not using a product. and finally, designers track the number of errors users make and how easily they can learn from these mistake.

Usability testing is usually conducted at the UX building stage before a project goes to the development team. it allows changing inefficient solution easier than in a complete product. moreover, usability testing allows watching the users' reactions while a product is used and estimate how much they like it or don't. this technique is helpful for gathering the essential information for the effective user-centered design.

## They pay attention to the information architecture 

in one of our previous articles, we defined the information architecture as a science which strives at organizing and structuring content so that users would easily adjust to the functionality of the product and could find everything they need without big effort.

many UX experts learn the IA principles since they believe the information architecture is a foundation of the effective design. if the content is badly organized, users May have difficulties with navigation, so they can get lost and feel annoyed. that's why even compelling content elements and powerfully UI design can fail without appropriate IA.

some May think that it's impractical to devote much time to IA building and the effective information architecture is crucial for powerful user experience design. it helps users quickly navigate through content and find everything they need without striking a blow.

## They  strive for clarity 

a quality digital product has to give a quick access to the features which users come for. the main objective for designers is to help people easily reach the desired functionality and make the process of usage pleasant and clear.

while planning problem solving UX, professionals should work out which of design elements will be helpful and which of them will distract users. unneeded functionality makes a product complicated and has the bad influence on the user experience. what's more, it's important to keep mental models which include common UI patterns for specific types of products. the thing is that design is often built on the elements which are already familiar to users. such an approach make navigation much more intuitive and simple.

## They consider real life context 

Being an idealist is not always a good thing, especially for UX masters. it may happen that some designers just forget to consider all the life factors which have the significant impact on UX.

a product is often built and tested in comfortable conditions, but people do not always have a chance to use apps in such pleasant environment. the modern world is too rash and people often have lots of tasks to do per minute. however, despite all the circumstances websites and mobile applications need to be enjoyable. designers have to consider possible disturbance and create UX that way so people could manage everything even without being 100% engaged with a product, especially a mobile application.

## They are open to new tools

Being a profound user of Photo-shop or sketch is a great advantage for a professional still it's always a good idea to try new tools. it may seem as time waste for some designers so they don't see a point in it. however, you May be surprised how advanced the new technology can be and what functionality it provides. learning new tools you are not obliged to apply them as the major instruments but you can use them as additional helpers which will be useful in certain situations.

## They never stop learning

 UX design is a field which never stays still. each day brings new ideas and opportunities which designers willingly share around the world. today there are so many techniques and methods which UX experts apply for creating quality products and it May be hard to keep up with all of them. nevertheless, for a UX professional, it's vital to learn as much as they can because this kind of knowledge only improves the professional skills.

in addition, designers should  not concentrate only on the design aspects. learning the wide spectrum of sciences which somehow relate to the design can be extremely helpful in the creative workflow. for example, it is recommended to learn psychology which helps to understand users and their needs as well as learn some basics of programming so that you could have the better vision of product development.

## They stay up to date

Digital technologies evolve pretty fast and UX experts have to follow the updates. it would be difficult to create the proper design without knowing the peculiarities of the devices it's meant for. moreover, the trends in design field are also changing quickly so UX designers need to know what's on the top now and which solutions step aside.

## They don't forget to get inspired

 some people may think that UX design is a complex science with the strict rules which doesn't have a room for creativity. however, it's a FALSE thought since UX masters never forget to let the imagination out of control. many original and unique solutions are born due to designers' open-mindedness and inspiration. that's why designers always have to charge their creative power with the help of their favorite activities.

## To sum up

let's remember Sean covey's words:"we become what we repeatedly do."work hard , improve yourself and you will be able to become a master in your field. 

stay tuned!!!

# Keep Fit. UI Design for Fitness apps

a professional athlete billie jean king once said:"sports teaches you character, it teaches you to play by the rules, it teaches you to know what it feels like to win and lose.--- it teaches you about life." sports has become a part of your routine a long time ago. even more, today a healthy lifestyle is a top trend which constantly grows its popularity across the world.

fitness apps are the key helpers for people who strive to get fit. their functionality gives a lot of opportunities and makes keeping fit easier. understanding the significant impact of these applications on users' everyday life, designers do their best to activate the problem-solving potential of fitness apps. today's article describes common screens and essential UI elements for fitness apps.

## sign-in and profile screen

fitness app is something like a pocket instructor telling you what to do and gives a feedback on your achievements. to make it more comfortable and personalized, designers need to create an effective profile UI.

before users obtain their profiles they usually go through the sign-in process. fitness apps, as well as the other ones, can allow logging in via social networks still there are some aspects which users have to fill in to create a personalized profile. the applications usually require the personal data including age, gender, weight, and height which helps to define users' physical condition. profile creation is often similar to filling in an app;ication form. this way users can easily provide the needed information to make a profile more personalized.

the major objective of a fitness app is to help users in their self-improvement, the reason why profiles should contain not only the personal data but also the user's achievements such as the number of burnt calories or personal records in sports. it's important to not to overload the profile screen with the unnecessary information otherwise user interface may look chaotic.

## home screen

it's a core element for any type of apps. home screens serve as the main point where users start the journey within a product. creating UI for home screen designers need to think of it as a center of navigation and make sure users will be able to operate it easily.

first of all, home screen should provide access to the other parts of the app. designers can choose various ways of the presentation from a sidebar with minimalistic icons to the click-able sub-headers leading to the different sections of app content. the choice often depends on the number of features provided by the product as well as the platform which it is meat for.

## activity screen

people who aim at getting fit always have to do various physical activities. fitness apps provide users with the feature which helps to track how active they are during a day. to make a sufficient UI for activity screen, designers include different kinds of activities and sports. traditionally, fitness apps provide tracking time spent on sports as well as measuring the distance which users cover during a day. the distance can be calculated in two ways: walking is measured by the number of steps and running is usually measured in miles(kilometers).

the information about users' activity is often presented via diagrams of various forms. such presentation contributes the effective visual perception of the data which includes many numerals. also, designers often apply custom icons representing each kind of activity. this way the screen looks clean and neat even if users have a really active life.

## heart rate screen

the heart is an engine which lets our body live and function, so it's important to follow its condition daily. many fitness apps can be connected to the various devices such as fitness wearables which allow measuring pulse. the applications usually transfer the data gathered with devices on a heart rate screen.

user interface representing the feature should be simple with the minimum of elements so that it could be easily operated. since the process of pulse measuring takes some time it may be a good idea to supply the UI with sufficient animation which will show the loading process. for example, motion designers can animate an illustration of the heart showing it beats. custom illustrations along with motion design can make UI look more proficient and make the process of the pulse measuring more interactive.

## sleep tracking screen

nice sleep is a guarantee of the human health. sports people know it better than anyone else and always try to control the time and quality of their sleep. fitness apps show the gathered information during a night which includes the time and stages of sleep. there are four stages of sleep: the first and the second are called light sleep, the third is deep sleep and the fourth is rem sleep. the applications track these stages and in the morning users can see the statistics. the data on sleep is often shown as graphs.

## calories screen

they say that fitness people are obsessed with calories. well, there is truth in the words because if you want to get fit it's vital to control what and how much you eat. as we said above, fitness applications show the information on the number of burnt calories based on the activity results. the calories data can be displayed on the activity screen as well as on the personal profile. however, it may be an effective solution to create a separate screen to provide users with the expanded information on the lost calories.

## progress screen

to stay motivated and continue self-improvement, it's important to know that the hard work gives results. the progress screen shows the statistics about users achievements along with failures. here the graphs will be the best choice. if people have the progress, they see that their results are getting better and the scales on the graphs go higher.

## schedule screen

there can be many sports activities in different time and different places so the schedule seems to be essential in this situation. the screen of schedule is standardized, but to make it unique and original, designers can add some interesting icons representing various sports directions.

## goals screen

goals move us to achieve more and more, especially if we talk about fitness. people stat doing sport because they have some goals like losing wight or shaping up. in fitness applications, users set maybe a bit less radical goals but easier to achieve on a regular basis. they often include walking a certain number of steps per day or week along with burning the fixed amount of calories.

the screen of goals can be presented as a sheet divided into categories: to do, doing, done. this way users will see how much they have managed to achieve and what they need to strive for. in addition, designers can settle the system of awards which will help users be even more motivated. we've already described awards as effective gamification tools which contribute increasing user engagement. you can find detailed info in our previous articles.

the sport requires persistence and fortitude and so does the creation of sufficient UI design. learn the basics, add some inspiration and you can surprise yourself. 

stay tuned!!!

# project

redesign of corporate identity for landscape firm lunnscape.

# process

Lunnscape is a company based in Florida, USA, and specializing in landscaping services to commercial properties like office and courtyard spaces, parks etc. the firm was founded by steven lunn in 2009: it's easy to see that the brand name presents the harmonic combination of the founder's name with the key word 《landscape》. being already established and known on the local market, the company strived for refreshing the visual identity and putting its promotion to the next level. the client came to us with a very basic branding they already used and wanted a new design corresponding to the modern trends and requirements and enhancing the connection with the customers.

we had already had a chance to create a brand identity for a landscape firm  - it was shared here in the case studies on logo design and corporate branding for andre. that made the challenge even more interesting, as the companies providing similar services had different approaches and vision of their brand images and needed new original looks. there is always the place for creative perspective in design, which makes the job so cool.

for this project, we accomplished a set of tasks according to the client's marketing strategy:

1. landscape company logo
2. slogan
3. theme illustrations
4. corporate letterhead, envelop, and business cards
5. stationery
6. corporate vehicle
7. style guile

# logo

brainstorming ideas on the task to design a logo for a landscaping business, most people will imagine something connected with plants, flowers or their elements. that's a natural and very quick association. actually, that approach had also been followed in the previous version of the logo presented with a simple stroke image featuring a leaf. however, keen on getting fresh stuff which would distinguish the company from the competitors, the client stated the wish to step aside from the traditional associations and try other creative directions. they wanted the brand sign to be dynamic, immediately connected to the theme of nature but moving away from ideas and patterns typical for landscaping logo design.

as well as in the previous case study on identity for reborn restaurant, early ideas were visualized in in the quick pencil sketches to catch the the possible silhouette of the future logo and discuss possible directions of creative search with the stakeholders. after that, the set of basic digitized options were offered. to make the picture full and ensure how far the logo should move from the common associations set, the designer provided the variety of options, as you can see below. some of the options were visually connected to the plants and greenery, for example, the letter mark made of leaves, the image of a flower, the shapes of landscape site patches also resembling the flower petals. also, there were shown the shapes of trees presented in balanced geometric forms giving the room for flexibility in a landscape logo design. the other options in this set were focused on dynamic images of living creatures like insects or birds.

so, it's easy to see that in general, the creative search moved around two global themes, flora and fauna, both effective to set the instant connection to the theme of nature and land care. thinking about the number of factors, the client put their preference on the image of a dragonfly as a mascot. here's the next stage of the logo design process - construction of a symbol image.

for the variety of usage options, the mascot image was added with the word mark featuring the company name and accomplished in a style harmonically corresponding to the mascot. so, the final lunnscape logo is designed as a mascot of a dragonfly in an aqua circle depicting one of the fauna symbols which habitats in Florida nature. the dragonfly visualizes a bright creature on a green lawn, besides, its wings look like flower leaves. turquoise circle with a dragon fly gives a solid stamp effect as well as looks playful due to the color palette. the word mark typography complements and also unveils the core brand services of the company.

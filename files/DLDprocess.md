## discover the unknown - phase 1 of the DLD process

the first phase of the three design-led-development (DLD) phase is called discover. if you are curious about the whole DLD process, check out the introduction. in discover, you gain a holistic overview of your project and bring everybody to the same level of knowledge. ideally, the team includes the product owner, user researcher, design thinking coach, UX designer, your customer, and users. since all great things come in threes, the discover phase is also divided into three steps: scope, research, and synthesize.

### getting ready for your DLD journey

scoping, i,e. setting an overall frame, is key for project management and will help you to describe the project to others. first, you need to define the overall goal of your project. who is your solution for? what business need is your project addressing? what is your unique value proposition?

then, describe what is in scope of your project and what is out of scope. this doesn't mean the scope can't be adapted based on what you learn in the discover phase, but you'll need a starting point. also, define main roles and work streams. for example, how will work and communication flow between team members? who keeps your stake holders and project lead up to date on your project's progress? even though there might be need for adjustments later on, a list of the project deliverables with their success criteria, milestones, and a rough time line serve well as a basis. then you are ready to move.

### no user research without user interviews and observations

the next step is called research. here, you find out about your users' real needs and opportunities to improve their life with your product. to do so, user research needs to be planned, prepared, and conducted. talking to your customer and the users' it department is definitely helpful. however, visiting your users in their working environment is crucial for getting valid insights. to get representative data, carefully decide on the roles, number, and characteristics of participants. apart from regular users, meeting extreme users can be quite informative. users who are new to the company, of different ages, or people who need to do this task for the first time.

prepare a user interview guide for your site visit. use the top-down approach: ask background questions, then open ended key questions to evoke stories, dig deeper with more detailed questions and warp it all up in the end. palnning also includes arranging logistics. acquisition of customers and users and assigning someone to conduct the interview. also, make sure you have all legal aspects covered.

during the user interview, you need to have a not taker to capture the observations. they will help you to capture facts, not interpretations. pay close attention to the user's task steps. also, focus on the user's needs, requirements, work triggers, and pain points. before closing, it's a nice gesture if you offer to keep your participants in the loop about the results and inform them about the outcome.

### preserve your discovery

afterward, it is time for the third step called synthesize, during which you and your team ensure substantiated user research results. document all details about your research activities, customer names, regions, and involved industries. how many users were involved in your research? was it an interview or validation? remote or on site? to get the bigger picture, synthesize research results from various users and from different companies, if available. the result is a widely applicable consolidated flow.

a persona outlining typical users' characteristics, context, needs, goals, and pain points derived from your findings will prove its value. how does the daily task look like? what do they need to fulfill their job? who do they need to talk to? when evaluating your design and development decisions, it will help you to stay focused on addressing the right needs and users.

besides describing a typical representative for the role, you need a holistic view on the business perspective, starting from the industry, over to business process specifics to the addressed business roles. also, map out planned and already existing apps related to be used, since those drive requirements regarding responsiveness, and device-specific integration features, such as camera or GPS. it will also be helpful to graphically represent a user's interaction via relevant use cases.

you've gained a clear understanding of the researched business role, your persona and the jobs to be done? congratulations, however, another review of your material by a team of user researchers helps you determine whether you are ready to move from the problem space on to the solution space.

## design to delight phase 2 of the DLD process

in the previous blog discover the unknown of the design led development series, you got to understand the problem that your user is facing. now, it is time to start creating your app. the design phase continues true to the motto all good things come in threes with threes with three steps: the product vision is refined via ideation, prototyping, and customer validation.

iterative cycles are the heart of design led development. iterations improve usability and ultimately, the user experience. i can't stress this enough early improvements can save a lot of time and resources and lead to faster product delivery.

###**Hacking Ideation**: **From inspiration to ideas**

The goal of the ideation phase is to generate as many ideas as possible to solve a problem without considering technical feasibility. Get creative with the collective wisdom of your whole team – the more interdisciplinary, the better!

We all know what it is like when looking for new ideas. Sometimes, as much we try, we can’t turn on our creative brain. Or, in a group, people might hold back their ideas until they first hear the far-out ideas others come up with.

Help is on its way. An ideation workshop will inspire your team to better come up with ideas. Choose a space that encourages creativity and interaction. An open atmosphere, elevated tables and chairs, plenty of sticky notes and whiteboards, as well as natural light can have significant impact on the outcome. Maybe you can even take your team to a co-innovation space, like an SAP Apphaus. Check out the tips and tricks in the graphic below and your flipcharts will quickly be covered with sticky notes.

Start with a summary about the users’ needs and goals based on the Discover phase. Then, framing a ‘How Might We’ (HMW) question could open up for first ideas. No worries, you don’t need to be a great writer. It simply needs to be vague enough to explore numerous answers while not being too broad, for example “HMW make our shopping experience faster and more appealing?”

Once done, give your team a bit of time to write down ideas. Finally, cluster the ideas to find themes, and prioritize them based on user needs. Be fine with moving other ideas to a parking lot. Finally, don’t forget to capture your results so that your team can look at the overall goal, the functionality or roles at any time.

###**Prototyping**

The next step, **prototype**, visualizes your ideas in prototypes. The spark ideas to provide a role-based, adaptive, simple, coherent, and delightful user experience. The guidelines do not only reflect best practices and examples, but also give an overview of floorplans, patterns and controls.

First, illustrate in a storyboard why the user likes to use the app, how the user performs his task step by step, and who he interacts with. Sketches and words tell the story best. Don’t focus on details; simply communicate the big picture. Then, establish a screen flow. It gives an overview of all screens that belong to the application and show the user’s motivation. A map can visualize the path users would take through the screens to fulfill their task.

Wondering how to start designing your app? Begin with a rough sketch, either on paper or digitally. Focus on the main screen elements. A concise title informs at a glance about a screen’s purpose. Give prominence to the most important pieces of content, such as fields and buttons. Use different background shading or bigger fonts to catch the user’s attention. Simple boxes could indicate where content is to be placed. Don’t hesitate to try out your sketches. Sketching is a powerful tool of communication.

Once you are happy with your prototype, think about its interaction details such as clicks, taps, data inputs, and other possible behaviors. Time to turn your sketches into digitalized clickable, so called high-fidelity prototypes, for example with Axure RP

###**Never too early to validate**

Before you take your designs to development, make sure your design will work for your users. BUILD, for example, allows you to engage users for feedback plus you can see how they interact with your app. Define the goal of your validation so that you can create tailored tasks.

Ideally, your validation participants are your users. Ask how they would complete the task while you listen, observe, and take notes. This gives you a chance to identify problems. Do multiple users run into issues with the same feature? Such findings are a great opportunity to improve the effectiveness of your design. After the test, analyze your findings and discuss with your team how they would like to incorporate findings. Ready to move on?

## deploy and enjoy phase 3 of the DLD process

During the second phase, Design, you came up with your prototype, and incorporated feedback. Now, it’s time to start the actual front-end to back-end development. Bring your software to life by following the three steps implement, test and deploy.

###**Prepare for implementation of your design**

A prioritized user story map can be a good basis for the developer who implements the design. So, bring all your artifacts and your team once again to your creative workshop room and put your heads together. User story mapping is an agile method to better understand the big picture of your product and user priorities. It is a visually organized top down-approach.

You could start with drawing a graph on a board and get your sticky notes ready: On the vertical axis, list your persona(s). On the horizontal axis, create the narrative flow of the map: Describe the main steps a user will perform with the product. Then, split them up into activities for each persona and then again into tasks. Now, the entire application is mapped out and you can detect high priority user stories by positioning the highest ones on top.

Now, you have the backlog, a list of features that are necessary to successfully complete your app. Additionally, you can easily identify the minimum viable product (MVP). The MVP is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and helps to provide feedback for future product development. Validate your user story map with users and stakeholders if possible. With the MVP, the development team can focus on the most essential functions first.

###**Test it out**

Consider showing development stages of the app in the system as soon as possible to your customer and users, even while the design is still being implemented. To organize testing, you could prepare a document including the tasks the user should perform and the expected results. Making notes during the test, especially discrepancies, or recording the screen can help you to analyze the results afterwards.

Usability tests focus on the efficiency and delightfulness of the design. Functional tests concentrate on certain functions, for example creating an order. For this, realistic master data in the system is required, such as customers or material. Integration tests go one step further by testing the whole sequence of a process. In procurement, for example, this would cover requesting material, ordering it, receiving a delivery note and the material, then storing it and finally auditing. Integration tests are ideally run by key users.

When doing the tests, consider questions such as: Does the application fulfill the requirements which were identified in the previous phases? Are the final design and the implementation perfectly synchronized? Does the design correspond to the SAP Fiori design guidelines?

###**The final countdown – deploy it**

Deployment means getting your program to a running state by installing the code where it can be used. Once you have released your solution, engage early adopters and begin gathering feedback for final production. Then, it is time to go live.

Now that you have delivered your app, you might want to find out how your app and your users work together. Surprise your app with a site visit, or ask your users for interviews or structured usability tests. Maybe support for other mobile devices, additional platforms, or enhanced features are on their wish list.
